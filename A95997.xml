            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </seg>Pon my publiſhing of my ſmal <hi>French Treatiſe,</hi> ſome Perſons of Note told me, that I ought to have written to the Whole World, and not to ſome certain particular <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> or <hi>Provinces</hi> onely. And others there were, that
<pb facs="tcp:169743:3"/>were of opinion, that I ſhould do wel to collect a brief <hi>Compendium,</hi> at leaſt, out of the ſaid <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> and publiſh it in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> giving me this reaſon too, becauſe that the <hi>Latine Tongue</hi> is the moſt Generally known throughout the World, and is the moſt eſteemed by all men. For ſeeing that there is no Nation in the World ſo Barbarous, but that it hath ſome in it, that are great Honorers of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved it to be the moſt Profitable way that could
<pb facs="tcp:169743:3"/>be, if a <hi>Compendium,</hi> at leaſt, of theſe ſo <hi>Uſefull,</hi> and <hi>Obvious Medicines</hi> (many whereof, they ſaid, were hitherto by none ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read, or heard of) were publiſhed in <hi>Latine.</hi> For, although all people do not underſtand <hi>Latine,</hi> yet they way every where meet with ſome or other, that do underſtand it; by whoſe aſſiſtance in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the ſame for them, they may poſſibly cure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Infirmities out of this Book. This was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to me, by thoſe Friends of mine, out of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:169743:4"/>affection, &amp; charity that they bear to All Men. Well then! what was now to be done? Nothing certainly, but to obey the Counſels of ſo great Perſons, my Friends: which, I confeſs, I ſhould have done ſooner, had not my daily Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Troubles, and alſo my very Old Age ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off both my Mind, and Pen from the buſineſs. I confeſs it would have been a more Acceptable thing to Forreigners, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the <hi>French Tongue,</hi> if this Book had been publiſhed in <hi>Latine,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169743:4"/>in an Elegant, and Polite Stile. But ſeeing that this is the buſineſs rather of <hi>Orators,</hi> and makes for the Glory only of thoſe They make choyce of for their <hi>Patrons,</hi> (where as no ſuch Politeneſs, or Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Words is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, either from a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> or a <hi>Phyſician;</hi>) yet however, that I might not be found wholly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on my part, I have thought fit, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to obey my Friends deſires, by letting alone my <hi>French Treatiſe</hi> as it is, (which yet I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb facs="tcp:169743:5"/>to have reprinted, having firſt digeſted it into a better Method,) that I might declare to the world, what power thoſe Noble Perſons have upon me. I have therefore made a brief Collection of ſome Particulars, that are more largely treated of in the laſt, and moſt perfect Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my <hi>French Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe;</hi> and eſpecially of ſuch things, as (Reaſon prompting me thereto) I have now had trial of for the ſpace of Three and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years (for ſo long it is, ſince I firſt Practiſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick)
<pb facs="tcp:169743:5"/>and in the uſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have been confirmed, by <hi>Experience;</hi> Which is the Mother of all Phyſicall <hi>Obſervations.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceave, that my <hi>French Book</hi> is not now neceſſary at all, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of thoſe things, which I have here treated of in Latine. And if there be any thing here, that ſhall pleaſe the Reader, and may be of uſe to himſelf, or his Friends, and yet is not ſo particularly, and fully treated of here; he may eaſily, by the help of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Interpreter, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:169743:6"/>to the <hi>French,</hi> where moſt of theſe things are more fully handled; and there he may have fuller ſatisfaction. Yet I muſt here deſire the Reader to take Notice, that I have inſerted many New Things in <hi>This Treatiſe,</hi> which are not in the <hi>French;</hi> as in like manner I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed more fully, and purpoſely of ſome other things here, which I toucht upon but by the By, as it were, in my <hi>French Treatiſe.</hi> An <hi>Index</hi> of all which I have here added, for the benefit of
<pb facs="tcp:169743:6"/>the Reader; that ſo he may, with a glance of his Eye onely, finde out, what he ſhall think is for his Turn.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> and <hi>Flux</hi> of the Belly, that is accompanied with Gripings, though there be no bloody Corroſion of the Guts, I have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially commended <hi>Whey:</hi>
               <note place="margin">That in a Flux, where there is no Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Patient muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from <hi>Whey,</hi>
               </note> but where there is with it neither a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor any Gripings, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, not onely the uſe of it, but of all other Liquids alſo, both Meats and Drinks, as far as the Conſtitution of the Patient could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169743:19"/>endure: yet have I allowed them to take ſome ſmall quantity of <hi>Red Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where by thè way the Reader is to take notice, that ſince I firſt commended the uſe of <hi>Whey</hi> in Griping Fluxes of the Belly; many have, without ever conſulting the Phyſitian, made uſe of it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in all Fluxes whatſoever; in ſo much that at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels</hi> it is by many made and ſold, onely to get money: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in my Treatiſe written in French, I particularly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbid the uſe of it in thoſe Fluxes, that are accompanied nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Feaver, nor Gripings in the Belly. Becauſe that in this Flux, the Acrimony, or Saltneſs of the Peccant Humor (which is the true cauſe of a <hi>Griping Flux</hi>) are ſuppoſed to be wanting;<note place="margin">The true Interna, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes of the <hi>Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flux.</hi>
               </note> which are cauſed by the exceſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heat of the Body, and for the moſt part of the Liver; or elſe from the heat of the Sun, Violent Exerciſe, over ſharp Meats, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169743:19"/>Drinks, or elſe from Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; Which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems not to allow of, either in, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Dog-days, unleſs neceſſity ſo require; becauſe it is then an unſeaſonable time for Purging. And no marvel; for while the weather is ſo extream hot, our Bodies are too much dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſequently the Humors grow very Acrimonious; and the Medicines themſelves, having alſo for the moſt part a peculiar Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their own, do ſometimes cauſe a <hi>Dyſentery:</hi> and therefore the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in another place inſinuates,<note place="margin">That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims cauſe the <hi>Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> upon the very day of Purging, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt drink a draught or two of <hi>Whey.</hi>
               </note> that when any would Purge their Bodies, they ſhould firſt make them moiſt, and fluid.</p>
            <p>And for this reaſon I adviſe my Patients, at what time of the year ſoever they chance to take Phyſick, upon the very day they take a Purge, (eſpecially if they have any Gripings in their Guts) to drink a draught or two of <hi>Whey;</hi> that by this means they may repel the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169743:20"/>Acrimony, whether of the Humor, or of the medicines: Which, as it immediately cures the Griping <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> and the <hi>Dyſentery</hi> it ſelf, ſo it is alſo a great Preſervative againſt them.</p>
            <p>So that it evidently appears from hence, that <hi>Whey</hi> hath as wel a <hi>Curing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That <hi>Whey</hi> is alſo a good <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative.</hi>
               </note> as a <hi>Preſerving</hi> faculty. And certainly it is a wonderful thing, how much <hi>VVhey</hi> excels all other Medicines in the cure of the <hi>Griping Flux,</hi> if it be taken in a great quantity, cold, and at any time of the day or night, either faſting, or at meats, or after meat, or late at night: and eſpecially at the beginning of the diſeaſe; when it ought to be taken in the greateſt quantity.</p>
            <p>And this is the reaſon that <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides,</hi> conſidering how agreeable to our Conſtitutions the nature of <hi>VVhey</hi> was, though there were neither a <hi>Griping Flux,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neceſſity, yet preſcribed the uſe thereof every Spring, for ſome time; beginning at firſt with a Pint
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169743:20"/>and a half: And this he did, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, to allay the heat of the Blood, which at that time begins both to grow hot, and to encreaſe; and withall to prevent thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that are cauſed thence; ſuch as are the <hi>Pleuriſie, Quinſie,</hi> and the like. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo himſelf, in his Book <hi>De victus ratione,</hi> in ſome diſeaſes, preſcribes no leſs then 12. <hi>Cotylae</hi> of boild Aſſes Milk (which is very ſerous) and, in caſe the Conſtitution of the Patient would bear it, he ſaies that he may take 16. <hi>Cotylae:</hi> and yet a <hi>Cotyla</hi> contains 9. Ounces. We are to conſider alſo, that from our very birth we are brought up with Milk, the greateſt part whereof by much is <hi>VVhey.</hi> Neither are we to be afraid of <hi>VVhey,</hi> as being too cold, ſeeing that a very Learned Author (to whom yet I cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) maintains that it is hot: for I conceave, that it is cold in ſome degree,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whey</hi> is cold, and ſomewhat cleanſing.</note> and withall ſomething cleanſing. And I remember once, when the Humor was very Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169743:21"/>I preſcribed my Patient, that was ſick of a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> to take, within the ſpace of Four and twenty hours, Eight cups of <hi>Whey:</hi> which within the ſaid ſpace of time (as appeared by exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) he did, with very good ſucceſs. And as, by this means, the further Corroſion of the Guts is ſtopped; ſo is the growing of any Ulcer in any part hereby alſo prevented, in caſe it be ſpeedily taken. Yet my Rule is, to preſcribe a Moderate quantity only of <hi>Whey,</hi> in this <hi>Flux.</hi> And thoſe, that have not any <hi>VVhey</hi> at preſent, may make uſe of <hi>ſcim'd Milk,</hi> which is made up of <hi>Whey</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe:</hi> and that you may make a ſeparation of them, you muſt put ſome <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> into the Milk, while it is over the Fire; and ſo you make your <hi>VVhey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for as much as there is no greater danger then from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the uſe hereof, you are therefore to have no regard at all (as appears by conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169743:21"/>whether your Patient be a Woman that hath her Courſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her,<note place="margin">That no regard is to be had either to Women that have their Courſes, or are with Child. That the Peccant Humor is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out the very firſt day of the <hi>Flux.</hi>
               </note> or perhaps is great with Childe. And therefore the very firſt day of the <hi>Flux,</hi> the Peccant Humor is not onely by proper Medicines to be purged out, but the Acrimony of it alſo is to be allayed, by drinking a ſufficient quantity of <hi>VVhey,</hi> even upon the very day of taking Phyſick. Yet we muſt remember, that we are not to give as large a quantity of <hi>VVhey,</hi> or of <hi>Purging Medicines</hi> to Great-bellied Women as to other people; but muſt preſcribe them ſo much the leſs quantity of either, by how much they are nearer the time of their being brought to bed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">You muſt fall again to your Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the <hi>Gripings</hi> ceaſe not.</note> And if by chance the <hi>Gripings</hi> of the belly ceaſe not, (as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they do, if the <hi>Flux</hi> be not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two, or three days ſtanding) you muſt fal again to your Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; &amp; in caſe they ſhould continue longer, perhaps a week, a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or three weekes; you muſt then often purge your Patient, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169743:22"/>that ſometimes for two or three days together, or at leaſt omitting but one day betwixt; according as you ſhall finde the Neceſſity in this caſe require; that ſo as well the Antecedent, as the Comcomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant cauſe may be removed: Which (though much aſſwaged) by how much it continues in wringing the Guts, ſo much the harder will the <hi>Flux</hi> be cured. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have many times obſerved, that even an inveterate <hi>Flux</hi> hath been perfectly cured, by the Means here laid down.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to be had to the ſtrength of the Patient,<note place="margin">Regard to be had to the ſtrength of the Patient.</note> if he be very weak, leaſt he be brought too low, by too frequent <hi>Purges:</hi> which may very eaſily be, in a body that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weakned by a continuall <hi>Flux:</hi> though there be no ſuch danger in a <hi>Flux</hi> that is but newly begun; where though they go commonly very often to ſtoole, yet it is but in a ſmall quantity. And where there is danger of too much
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169743:22"/>weakning the Party, you muſt uſe ſo much the more gentle Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and if either by them, or without them, by the violence of the diſeaſe, too great a quantity either of Humors, or of Blood hath been evacuated; you may then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſtop the <hi>Flux</hi> (at leaſt for a while) either by <hi>Aſtringent</hi> or <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying</hi> Medicines, or elſe by ſuch <hi>Clyſters</hi> as are here ſet down.</p>
            <p>Now for an Ordinary <hi>Purge,</hi> they uſe to adminiſter to thoſe that are of ripe years, 4. Ounces of the ſyrup of <hi>Roſes Solut.</hi> mixed with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> with ſome ſpoonfuls of <hi>VVhey;</hi> or in caſe you cannot get any <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> you may take five Ounces of Syrup of <hi>Roſes Solut.</hi> without <hi>Rhubarb.</hi> But to younger people, and ſuch as are of weak Conſtitutions, you muſt give a leſs quantity. And in caſe (as it often happens) it ſhould not work to any purpoſe, you may then adde about an Ounce of a <hi>Cordial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction Solut.;</hi> as you may leave it out, if it be too violent. And if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169743:23"/>ſo be the ſick Party cannot endure to take any Syrup, he may inſtead thereof take the Infuſion of two or three Drams of <hi>Rhubarb</hi> made with <hi>VVhey;</hi> or about the quantity of two Ounces of <hi>Calabrian Manna</hi> infuſed in <hi>VVhey:</hi> and you may give an Ounce of the aforeſaid Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, mixt with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> to a child; and half an Ounce to little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with a ſpoonful, or two, of <hi>VVhey.</hi> And you may give as much, or very near, with a little <hi>VVhey,</hi> to Children that ſuck: to whom I have known <hi>VVhey,</hi> with the Yolk of an Egg, and crums of White bread, mixed together, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for meat, and <hi>VVhey</hi> onely for drink, with very good ſucceſs. This Syrup mixed with <hi>VVhey,</hi> as it ſeemed to me a very proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for this diſeaſe, and ſuch as might very ſafely be adminiſtred, without any danger of over-purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo hath the ſucceſs herein ſo often anſwered my expectation, as that I was ſcarſely ever put to make uſe of any other Medicine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169743:23"/>inſtead of it. And although theſe things, if they be ſpeedily, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred, do cure both in a ſhort time, and certainly enough; yet notwithſtanding the carefull Phyſitian muſt, in the beginning of this diſeaſe, not faile to make uſe of <hi>Ordinary Clyſters</hi> alſo: yea,<note place="margin">What <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> are in this diſeaſe to be made uſe of.</note> and ſometimes too, if the body be not throughly purged, he muſt then have recourſe to <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which muſt be compoſed of a Pint of <hi>VVhey,</hi> or more, and four or five Ounces of Syrup of <hi>Roſes Solut.</hi> with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or the like quantity of <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Roſes Solut.</hi> The <hi>Ordinary Clyſters</hi> uſed in this caſe, are made of the ſame quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>VVhey,</hi> mixed with two raw Yolks of Eggs. And to the end the Party may retain them the longer, and ſo conſequently they may work the more effectually; I would have them always, even in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, adminiſtred Cold:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clyſters</hi> to be given cold.</note> Which I would have alſo to be often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if there be an extream <hi>Griping</hi> of the Guts with the <hi>Diarrhaea;</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169743:24"/>you muſt apply it ſo, yet much more frequently, in caſe the Party void Blood: which if it ceaſe, and if ſome Purulent Martter onely, or the ſame mixed with a very little Blood onely, be voided from ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> you muſt then give your <hi>Clyſter</hi> a little warm.

And even in the depth of a very hard Winter, I have with very good ſucceſs, done the like to little Children, that were not above two, or three moneths old. And certainly, if it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt me about Thirty years ſince, by ſome Outlandiſh Phyſitians, and thoſe of no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Note neither, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both Reaſon, and <hi>Hippocrate</hi>

               </note> in ſo much that I have diverſe times cauſed 2. 3. or 4. ſpoonfulls of it to be put in, as well in the <hi>Ordinary</hi> ones, as into that more <hi>Aſtringent</hi> one; and that in a <hi>Flux</hi> of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where the Patient hath been in ſo ſad a condition, as to void in one day near two or three Pints of Blood. Neither did my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fail me; for the Blood by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo piercing a Cold, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly repelled, and the Orifice of the Vein contracted, and ſhut up.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169743:25"/>moſt certain remedy in this caſe, (when all other means have failed) hath been, to put the Patients feet into <hi>VVarm VVater;</hi> and that, if need ſo require, as far as to the very Knees, or higher: as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one, that was at the very point of death, whence by the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of this Experiment he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily recovered, when both his Legs, and Thighs, for want of Blood, had now grown cold: and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; for, his Blood flying up to his head, he had loſt no leſs then Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pints of it, at the Noſe; as by moſt exact obſervations was found.</p>
            <p>But to leave this Digreſſion, and to return to my former diſcourſe of the <hi>Flux</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> in a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> I ſay; that wherever I found the ſtrength of my Patient to have been too much weakned, by ſo violent, and plentiful Voyding of Blood by ſtool,<note place="margin">Letting of Blood is very ſeldome admitted here.</note> I never appointed the breathing of a Vein, which yet may heer ſeem to be proper enough: and I have been very ſparing alſo in preſcribing it, in this <hi>Dyſenterical

For, the Heat of the Patient is attempered ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the ſtore of <hi>VVhey</hi> which he muſt take; which alſo ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſwages the ſaltneſs, or Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Peccant Humor:</hi> in ſo much that I have been ſo fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, ſeeing the Humor it ſelf

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169743:34"/>known many times old men, and thoſe too, that have been withall <hi>Hydropical,</hi> to have been taken with this diſeaſe: For there is even in them a ſufficient ſtock of <hi>Salt, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Humors, to cauſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
            <p>Neither let it ſeem ſtrange to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one; that the Parts affected by a <hi>Cold Humor</hi> do ſwell: for he ought to take notice, that when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this <hi>Malignant Humor</hi> the Natural Heat is weakned,<note place="margin">The parts affected here, like as in the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſwell, by reaſon of a Cold Humor; becauſe that the Natural Heat is weakned too much by the Malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that Humor.</note> this both may, and muſt be: and eſpecially if he do but conſider, that (for the greater clearing of this buſineſs) that part of the Body that is taken with an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> immediately alſo begins to have a ſwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Which ſeeing it is not imaginable that it ſhould be cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mutual conflux of both Humors, we therefore ought to think, that it muſt proceed from the <hi>Malignant Heat</hi> of <hi>Choler,</hi> that hath ſo far weakned the <hi>Natural Heat.</hi> Which <hi>Bilious Humor,</hi> as it is likened to the Element of <hi>Fire;</hi>

            <p>But ſuppoſe that the excellent vertues of <hi>Cold Water</hi> in the Cure of this Diſeaſe were never before diſcovered to the world; or that other its excellencies, in other the like Caſes, have heitherto been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written, nor heard of: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this, I ſay, Muſt the Vaſt Abyſs of Phyſical knowledge, and the large ſtock of the ways of <hi>Cures,</hi> have before this been neceſſarily exhauſted and drawn dry? Is it impoſſible to ſay, or write any thing, that may be deduced out of the very Principles of Nature, which may be of good uſe in the Curing of the diſeaſes men are ſubject unto, and particularly of the intollerable Paines of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and the like? Certainly there are diverſe, that having by experience found the excellent vertue of <hi>Cold Water,</hi> for the aſſwaging of thoſe Horrid Torments of the <hi>Gout,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169743:35"/>(which are a ſecond Hell) will be ready with a very gratefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, Publickly to extoll the ſame. And thoſe, that to the uſe hereof, have added the opening of a Vein, either upon the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or ſomewhere neare it, will cry it up to the ſame height. And to the end that what concerns the Publike Good, may Publickly be known, (I ſhall deale Ingeniouſly, with thoſe that are Ingenious) I ſay, that I have known many, who have teſtified, that among the ſo many, and various Medicines that are in uſe for the cure of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, they have not known, nor applied any, that hath ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſwaged, if not utterly cured (as it ſometimes hath done,) the intollerable pains of this diſeaſe, as <hi>Cold Water;</hi> eſpecially when it is joyned with Letting of Blood.</p>
            <p>For it is certain enough, (as I have proved in my <hi>French Treatiſe</hi>) that the Pains in the <hi>Gout</hi> are cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by any <hi>Cold</hi> defluxion of Humors from the Head, but by a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169743:36"/>
               <hi>Hot Humor,</hi> which is either an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonious,</hi> or a <hi>Salt</hi> one, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Liver,</hi> and gathered together in ſome neighboring part, till ſuch time, as that Nature drives it forth, by the <hi>Greater Veins,</hi> into the <hi>Capillary,</hi> as into certain ſmal Channels by nature deſigned for the conveighing of humors: whence it is conveighed to the Joynts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Aliment provided for the nouriſhment of the parts of the Body; and commonly firſt of all it ſeiſes upon the <hi>Great Toe;</hi> and as the cauſe of the diſeaſe increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it afterwards ſeiſeth upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joynts alſo.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe therefore my Counſel hath been, that a Vein ſhould be opened, both in the <hi>Great Toe,</hi> and alſo in other parts that are neareſt to it: that ſo the next <hi>Antecedent cauſe,</hi> which lies in thoſe Veins, and fomenteth the <hi>Concomitant Cauſe,</hi> lying neare unto it, may be taken away: which being removed, the pain is either aſſwaged, or altogether ceaſeth.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169743:36"/>For I cannot beleeve that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant cauſe</hi> lieth in the very <hi>joynt,</hi> where the Bones are not wrap'd about with any <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> which is of moſt exquiſite ſenſe, (for ſo all Motion muſt needs be painfull) but inſtead of that are invironed with a <hi>Griſtle,</hi> and joyned together with <hi>Ligaments,</hi> that are void of al ſenſe: ſo that the pain muſt therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be attributed to the neighboring parts, which are moſt ſenſible. In the producing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing that this <hi>Antecedent Cauſe</hi> is alſo to be ſuppoſed to cooperate, I am clearly of opinion, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Letting of Blood,</hi> either by way of <hi>Revulſion,</hi> or <hi>Derivation,</hi> we ought to fall immediately to the opening of a Vein upon the part it ſelf: unleſs the body being very Plethorical, or the Patient young, or the part lying convenient for <hi>Revulſion,</hi> which had formerly been infeſted with the ſame diſtemper, do require the ſame. For in other Caſes you muſt be careful how you let Blood; both becauſe, my opinion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169743:37"/>is, that people ought to be let Blood once or twice a year, by way of Prevention, and eſpecially in the aforeſaid <hi>Great Toe,</hi> or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Body hath uſually been moſt afflicted with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; as alſo, becauſe that when it hath ſeiſed upon ſeveral joynts at once, the violence of it ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the opening of a Vein, where neither the Age of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor any other impediment is againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing it is confeſſed, and aſſented to by all Phyſicians, that <hi>Contraries are cured by Contraries;</hi> why may I not lift up my voice, and make uſe of my Pen, in the juſt Praiſes of this our <hi>Cold Water?</hi> Eſpecially, ſeeing I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Experience</hi> on my ſide; (who is the beſt Miſtreſs in all Sciences whatſoever) and that back'd with <hi>Reaſon</hi> two. I ſhall not here ſpeak of <hi>Young</hi> men, or of thoſe of <hi>Perfect Age;</hi> but I ſhall onely here have to do with <hi>Old men,</hi> (who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Saltneſs of Humors,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169743:37"/>they commonly abound, are very much ſubject to this terrible Diſeaſe:) many of whom, when they either already felt, or were in feare of theſe Tormenting pains, have by my Counſel had recourſe immediately to this drinking of <hi>Cold Water;</hi> which drinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for many days, weekes, yea and moneths together, it hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well with them, as that many of them, who have been very far ſtricken in years, have found very great eaſe hereby; and that too without any offence to the Stomack, or hinderance of Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and have continued thus now for ſome years ſpace together; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinking a draught of it off eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning: which courſe they alſo reſolve to continue while they live. And ſome, that had uſed to drink Wine conſtantly, did the ſame; drinking Water at their Meals, but moderately.</p>
            <p>And although that in an <hi>Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Gout,</hi> or where the Party is very old, or where there are other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169743:38"/>either <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> or <hi>Occult</hi> Cauſes, hindering it, I have ſaid that the uſe of it would do very little, or no good at all; yet in very many of this kinde of patients, where I have judged the uſe of it to be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I do here teſtifie to the world, that I have had very good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>And as for all other Medicines, whether they be thoſe they call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyna;</hi> that is, <hi>Mitigatives</hi> of paine; or thoſe they call <hi>Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives,</hi> that is, ſuch as diſpel the cauſe of the diſeaſe in the <hi>Gout;</hi> as I have made little mention of them in my <hi>French Treatiſe;</hi> ſo in this, (where I commend ſo much the uſe of <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and <hi>Letting of Blood</hi>) do I make as little: becauſe, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Mitigative</hi> Medicines, by too much relaxing of the parts Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, do open an eaſie paſſage for the return of the ſharp Humor back again upon them; ſo the <hi>Diſcuſſive,</hi> by over-drying the parts, diſpoſe them toward the <hi>Knotted Gout.</hi>

            <p>Yet thoſe that either cannot, or will not patiently endure the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

            <p>Neither is this taking of <hi>Cold Water</hi> (as I have preſcribed it) uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful onely in aſſwaging, and curing the pains of the <hi>Gout</hi> in the <hi>Feet, Hands,</hi> and <hi>Shoulders;</hi> but alſo the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or Hip-Gout, which is both the moſt violent, and the hardeſt to be removed of all the reſt.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169743:49"/>in caſe the Application of it hath not bin deferred too long: although I am very certain, that where no ſpeedy cure hath been taken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet the making uſe of this <hi>Cold VVater</hi> the next day after, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the aforementioned ſpace of time, (if the <hi>Swelling</hi> hath not been too great) hath perfectly cured the Party.

            <p>And here I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that it was not in vain that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> admoniſheth us, that the <hi>Gout</hi> in the <hi>Feet</hi> is cured by a <hi>Large Effuſion of Cold VVater:</hi> for it is moſt certain, that by holding the Foot, that is affected, a long while in the ſame, both the <hi>Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> abateth, and the <hi>Redneſs</hi> of the part, and the pains and aſſwaged alſo. But ſeeing that, by reaſon of the Corrupted Blood, which may ſpeedily return again to the part,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169743:49"/>the Pain may eaſily be renewed; my judgement is, that this Bathing in <hi>Cold VVater</hi> is to be repeated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for the ſpace of five or ſix days together. And in this ſenſe do I underſtand that Doctrine of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> to the great comfort of the Patient, when as his pain, and the continuance of his Diſeaſe ſhall be ſo taken off, as that he ſhall now be troubled with it ſo many days onely, as otherwiſe he ſhould have been weeks.</p>
            <p>Some alſo that have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <hi>Gout</hi> in their Feet, that they may either utterly avoyd the falling into a <hi>Relapſe,</hi> or at leaſt may have but light touches of it, make uſe of this Bathing in <hi>Cold VVater</hi> every day, ſo long a ſpace of time as a man may be ſaying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> But for as much as the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the <hi>Humor</hi> cannot always be ſo clearly taken away as could be wiſhed, nor the Humor it ſelf purged out: the ſame may be farther ſuppreſſed by the taking of <hi>Cold VVater</hi> inwardly,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169743:50"/>and the <hi>Humor</hi> it ſelf may be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, as Occaſion ſhall require, either by opening a <hi>Vein,</hi> or by ſome <hi>Purging Medicine</hi> proper in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Neither is this <hi>Bathing</hi> of the <hi>Feet</hi> in <hi>Cold VVater</hi> a Remedy in the Pains of the <hi>Leg</hi> onely, and the joynts thereof; but it cures alſo the Inveterate Pains of the <hi>Head,</hi> and the Continual <hi>Catarrhes,</hi> and <hi>Defluxions</hi> from thence. For it is certain, that if the Head be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cold VVater,</hi> as far as the <hi>Middle</hi> of the <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Hinder part</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> and to the end of the <hi>Noſe</hi> before, ſo that there be left juſt ſo much of the Noſe out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that the Party may have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Breathing onely; and that this be done ſo long, as while a man may be ſaying the <hi>Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the pain of the Head, though it hath been of long continuance, wil hereby be removed, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions ſtopped; as hath often been proved by experience. Or elſe inſtead of this putting the Head
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169743:50"/>into <hi>Cold Water</hi> (which ſeems to be very improper for Women) you may take a Linnen Cloath, dipped in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and apply the ſame ſeveral times to the Head. For ſeeing that it is not ſo much the <hi>Moyſture</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> that is here requiſite, as the Peircing <hi>Coldneſs</hi> of it; I conceive that it would do very much good in this caſe, if we ſhould take a Linnen Cloath that had been dipt in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and wringing it well, we ſhould apply the ſame to the Head of the Party, having firſt covered it all over with another dry Linnen Cloath, and that to be doubled too, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this to the Head for the ſpace of a Quarter of an Hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and ſo repeating the ſame ſome certain times.</p>
            <p>And I have been very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this opinion of mine, by an experiment of it made upon a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight, named Sir <hi>Toby Matthews,</hi> a man no leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for Wiſdom, then fit for Publike Truſt. This Gentleman
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169743:51"/>having been troubled twenty years together with an intolerable pain on one ſide of his Head, and alſo with a Continual, and violent <hi>Defluxion</hi> from the Head, diſtilling through his Palate, and Noſe, in ſo great a quantity, as that he could never go without a wet Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in his pocket: he was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily cured of both theſe Maladies in the ſixtieth year of his age, by this <hi>Bathing</hi> his Head in <hi>Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as that till the ſeventieth year of the ſame, which he hath now paſſed, he hath never had the leaſt touch of either, during the ſaid ſpace of time; and being now bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in health then ever he was in his life before, to prevent his falling into the ſame Infirmities again, he uſeth the ſaid Immerſion of his Head in <hi>Cold Water</hi> all the year long, and even in the depth of Winter alſo. And he ſaith, that he received this profitable Adviſe from a certain Engliſh Nobleman, who having himſelf been a long time much tormented with the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169743:51"/>ſame Diſeaſe, had by this means cured both himſelf, and very many others who were alike affected, and reſtored them to their perfect health, to the great admiration of all men.</p>
            <p>And that this Practiſe is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſound <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Conſtant Experience. For it is certain, that the Skin of the Head by this means is ſo hardned, and ſtrengthened, and fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Cold,</hi> as that it is able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Head againſt the greateſt that can be, and againſt any other External injuries whatſoever; and alſo to mitigate the <hi>Hot Diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature</hi> of the Head, and the <hi>Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of its <hi>Humors,</hi>

                  </gap>pelas;</hi> (neither of which is at all here to be feared:) as it often uſes to happen, when the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> or thin Skin that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enwrappes the <hi>Shin-bone,</hi> is inflamed by a <hi>Wound,</hi> or <hi>Bruiſe;</hi> ſo that the neighboring parts come thereby to Gangrene, and putrifie; and all life in them being quite extinct, and afterwards by degrees all life alſo throughout the reſt of the whole body, the Carkaſſe is in the end brought to the grave. And theſe Accidents, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims befall young people, but old folk very often, I have the more largely dilated upon, that men
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169743:55"/>might take the better notice of the moſt evident Danger in this caſe, which yet by ſo facile, and a ready Remedy may eaſily be avoided.</p>
            <p>For it is very certain, that the aforeſaid <hi>Immerſion</hi> in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> if it be duly made uſe of, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Wound</hi> is receaved, or elſe within ſome few hours after; it will infallibly and perfectly cure the ſame. And I can aſſure the Reader, that for theſe three and fifty years ſpace (for ſo long it is, ſince I firſt lighted upon this way of curing of Wounds receaved upon the Leg, which I had never before either read, or heard of,) I have never known any of my Patients to have ſuffered hereby any great pain, much leſs Death; but all things have ever ſucceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Wiſh; as I have always by moſt curious Obſervation found.</p>
            <p>Thus in Autumn, in the year 1674, in a Wound almoſt all along the whole Leg, and that where the Party was very old too, after he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169743:56"/>had (by my Preſumption) bathed his Leg a good while together in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> he had not the leaſt feeling of any pain in his Leg, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any <hi>Purulent Matter</hi> bred in the Wound; and that by reaſon of the ſo effectual Repulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and the other <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> (as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) by the ſaid <hi>Cold Water:</hi> Which, leaſt by the Patients too raſh venturing upon Motion, they ſhould by chance be called down toward the part againe; it will be neceſſary that he keep himſelf quiet for a while. To the end therefore that in theſe, and the like Accidents, there may be an orderly, and a ſecure way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, we muſt be ſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this <hi>Immerſion</hi> at the leaſt for half an hour, or rather an hours ſpace, till ſuch time as the Part Affected ſhall be reduced to its proper Temperature, or be rather brought down to a Colder Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then its own Natural is; that ſo the aforeſaid dangerous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169743:56"/>may with the greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be hindered. Which being done, there is nothing at all to be laid upon the Wound, ſave onely ſome of that ſmall <hi>Film,</hi> or thin <hi>Skin,</hi> that lies immediately under the Shell of an Egg, enwraping the whole Egg about: which you muſt be very carefull that it fall not off, or be careleſly pulled off, or removed from off the Wound; till ſuch time as that having lain there for ſome days, or weeks ſpace, according to the Conſtitution of the Patient, and of the Part Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the Wound being cloſed up, and grown whole, it falls off of it ſelf. And yet I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that, where this thin <hi>Egg-Skin</hi> hath been gently taken off, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf hath defended the part, now left naked with a dry and hard <hi>Scab;</hi> which alſo, when the Wound was perfectly whole, fell off: for there was danger, that if it had been violently pulled off, the <hi>Sore</hi> would have grown worſe again, if at leaſt it be proper, in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169743:57"/>this Caſe, to uſe the Word, <hi>Sore,</hi> which preſuppoſeth <hi>Purulent Matter;</hi> whereas here was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo much as the thinneſt moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that could be, ſeen to come from the Wound all the while, till it was perfectly whole. As in like manner, where this my Counſel hath been followed, no running <hi>Matter</hi> at all hath been ſeen to come from ſuch Wounds, as have been either in the <hi>Heads,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Body, where ever it hath been my fortune to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Patients of this nature, either with Surgeons joyned with me, or otherwiſe; ſave only in one Wound that a Perſon of Quality, of eighty four years of age, had receaved in his Leg: where, although the blood had been repelled, by the ſpeedy, and continued Application of <hi>Cold Water;</hi> yet ſome ſmall quantity of <hi>Purulent Matter</hi> coming from the Wound, on the ſixth day after the hurt receaved, (yet without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foregoing Pain, or Heat in the part,) the Surgeons that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169743:57"/>thither were preſently of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that for the perfecting of the Cure, they were to make triall of <hi>Suppurating Medicaments:</hi> which when they had, without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, applied; and had put the Patient to a great deal of pain, and had cauſed much <hi>Purulent Matter</hi> to come from the Wound; I was then ſtreight ſent for again: where immediately cauſing the ſaid Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments to be taken away, and cleanſing the Wound with <hi>Whey,</hi> I applied to the <hi>Sore</hi> a Plaſter, that is uſually called, <hi>Emplaſtrum Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apompholigos;</hi> which being well bound about with dry Linnen Cloathes, and then taking other Linnen Cloathes, and dipping them in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and ſo wrapping them all round about the place, having firſt well wrung the ſame, and changing them ever and anon; I cauſed this Application to be uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour together at leaſt, that ſo the part Affected might be freed from all Heat, and Pain: which Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169743:58"/>I cauſed to be repeated for the ſpace of four or five days together, till ſuch time as the Wound was perfectly healed up, not the leaſt drop hardly of <hi>Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter</hi> in the mean while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen to come from the ſame. In like manner as at other times, while the aforeſaid thin <hi>Egg-Skin</hi> was ſticking ſtill upon the Wound, when there was very little, or no ſenſe at all, either of Heat, or Pain in the part Affected, I have cauſed a wet Linnen Cloath, well ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and the Water well wrung out, to be wrapped about the place, That ſo the Penetration of the Cold might aſſiſt the ſaid <hi>Skin</hi> and might moyſten it, without pulling if off. Yet if you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, that there is any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Skin,</hi> you muſt then take it off; and ſo, cleanſing the Wound, you may apply to the Wound the aforeſaid <hi>Emplaſtrum Diapompholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> and the place muſt be wrapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a Linnen Cloath dipped in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and afterwards well
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169743:58"/>wrung, in the manner we ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Neither was I at all reſtrained from making uſe of the aforeſaid Experiment, by that Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. where he ſaies, that <hi>Cold things are not to be applied to thoſe parts, whence Blood either already iſſues, or is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iſſue;</hi> for he there ſpeaks of ſuch Wounds, as are to be cured by <hi>Suppuration:</hi> neither was the world then at all acquainted with this way of healing up of Wounds perfectly, by the <hi>Firſt Intention,</hi> by the Application of <hi>Cold Water,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> there ſpeaks of. And although tis true, that <hi>Cold Water,</hi> applied to any <hi>Sore,</hi> cauſeth ſome Smart, and Pain in the part; yet there is much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to be had (as the ſame <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> elſe where rightly admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us) to the exceeding great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit here to be expected, then to the very little harm, or Annoyance; as indeed the Smart is but little, which is cauſed by the application
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169743:59"/>of <hi>Cold things</hi> to the part.</p>

                  <hi>Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> cureth Wounds, when a <hi>Nerve</hi> is hurt.</note> And I conceive, a Queſtion might here very well be moved, whether or no in the Hurting of a <hi>Nerve,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <hi>Cut,</hi> or by a <hi>Prick,</hi> where by the Surgeons neligence in ſtriking a Vein either with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, or other Inſtrument, he hits upon a Nerve; whence common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow <hi>Impoſtumations, Gangrenes,</hi> yea and Death it ſelf, (although the Prick be never ſo ſmall) this Application of <hi>Cold Water</hi> for a good while together, as hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſet down, might not be of good uſe: Notwithſtanding that our Authors will not hear of the applying of <hi>Cold</hi> things, (at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Cure,) and ſuch <hi>Medicaments</hi> as are of an Aſtringent faculty, and are therefore proper to cloſe up the Wound; as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes is uſually practiſed. As to inſtance, among the reſt, in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus,</hi> who would not at all allow of this way of proceedings, in the curing of the King of <hi>France,</hi> that had had a Nerve pricked by his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169743:59"/>Surgeon, in being let Blood: but the courſe he took, was, to poure into the Wound <hi>Oyl</hi> to <hi>Turpentine</hi> warm, mixed with a little <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> whereby the <hi>Nerve</hi> was dried up, and the Sharp Humor proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, which put him to great pain was conſumed; yet both it, and all fear of the other aforementioned Accidents together with it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ceaſed. Which courſe of his, if it had not ſucceeded according to his deſire, he had then reſolved to have cauterized the <hi>Nerve,</hi> by pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the Wound ſome drops of ſcalding <hi>Oyl;</hi> or perhaps he would rather have cut it in two, then that he would have ſuffered the Fatal <hi>Atropos</hi> to have cut the thread of the Kings Life in ſunder.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Paraeus</hi> obſervings, that, notwithſtanding the application of theſe <hi>Hot</hi> things, the Conflux of Humors toward the part affected was alſo to be hindered, to prevent the aformentioned accidents; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the receaving of the Wounds, he fell to make uſe of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169743:60"/>
               <hi>Refrigerating, and Repulſive</hi> Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations over the whole arme, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying it with a very ſtreight <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> which bound down the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> exceeding cloſe, binding the ſame about the whole Arme, from the Hand-wreſt up to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing this curing of Wounds by the Application of <hi>Hot Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> is <hi>Accidental</hi> onely, as it that of curing a Burnt Finger, by the Fire, as we have ſaid before; why ſhould we not rather go the direct way to work in theſe kind of cures, by <hi>oppoſing Contraries to Contraries;</hi> and ſo endeavor by this Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cold Water</hi> to repel the <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> from the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and to allay the Pain, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Acrimonious Humor, that draws the ſame to it? For that this will do the buſineſs, is evident enough, by the ſeveral cures that have been wrought in Wounds that have been made upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Fingers,</hi> (wherein there is abundance of <hi>Nerves</hi>) either by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169743:60"/>the bitings of Dogs, or by hurts from ſome ſharp inſtrument; all which, by this Advice of mine, I mean onely by this Long-continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bathing</hi> in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeating the ſame, have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three or four days ſpace been perfectly cured, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the appearance of any <hi>Purulent Matter</hi> at all coming from the Wound: as I can give a Particular Inſtance in one very large, and deep Wound, that was made by a <hi>Hatchet,</hi> where a part of the <hi>Back</hi> of the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Fore-Finger</hi> were cut to the very bone. Which that it could not poſſibly be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hurting of ſome <hi>Nerves,</hi> nor indeed without the cutting of them off in two rather, (whereby, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the Wound had much leſs danger in it, then if a <hi>Nerve</hi> had been but prickt onely, or but half cut off) appears plainly by this; becauſe that when the Cut on the Finger was quite cloſed up, and perfectly healed, the party could not by any means lift it up, nor
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169743:61"/>indeed ever will be able to do ſo. And although that in theſe, and the like Wounds, there uſes to be ſome pain in the part the next day, &amp; the Hand will begin to ſwel; yet by reiterating the ſaid bathing in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> both the <hi>Pain,</hi> and the <hi>Swelling</hi> will immediately Vaniſh: and if it be but quietly kept up in a Scarff, faſtned about the Neck, the Party ſhall never hear of them more. Yet nevertheleſs, in a caſe ſo dangerous, as is the <hi>Pricking</hi> of a <hi>Nerve,</hi> which, after long, and moſt tormenting pains, together with the aforenamed Accidents, hath brought ſo many thouſands to their graves; I ſhall willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Practiſe of this bathing in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> (though it promiſe abundantly a moſt happy ſucceſs) to the Examination, and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the moſt Skilful in our Profeſſion.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169743:62"/>Expectation of their Patient; and that they would rather look after as well their <hi>Own,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their <hi>Art,</hi> and would preſerve a ſafe Conſcience (which is much violated, where the Cure of any Wound is protracted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe) rather then minde their own gain onely: who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hearkening to my Counſell, and finding the ſucceſs anſwer the Experiment, confeſſed, that it was to be preferred before all other; notwithſtanding that they knew well enough, that by this uſe of <hi>Cold Water</hi> coming into practiſe, there would much of their gains be loſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs here adde, that ſome are of opinion, that thoſe that are bitten by a <hi>Mad Dog,</hi> by the Application of <hi>Cold Water</hi> to the Part Affected, or rather by the <hi>Bathing</hi> of the ſame in the ſaid <hi>Cold Water,</hi> may be preſerved from that they call <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> or the <hi>Dread of Water:</hi> and they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that by this means that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:169743:62"/>may be overmaſtered, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. And this they conceave to be no unlikely thing, if there be any credit to be given to <hi>Cornelius Celſus;</hi> who writes, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Remedy in this caſe, is, to throw the Party, that is troubled with this <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> unawares, either into a Fiſh Pond, or into a River; and, when he is thus plunged in over head and ears, to let him ſtay there ſo long, till ſuch time as he is filled with water, whether he will or no. For, by this means, (ſaith he) both his <hi>Thirſt,</hi> and his <hi>Dread</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> are cured. For he is ſo extreamly fearful of coming near any Water, that though he be never ſo thirſty, yet, like another <hi>Tantalus,</hi> he is in ſo ſtrangly a ſad Condition, that neither by faire, nor foul means can he be got to take the leaſt drop of any kinde of Liquor whatſoever; as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen, and made the Experiment. Which <hi>Immerſion</hi> (ſay they) if it be of uſe when the Party is gone ſo far as to a <hi>Hydrophobia;</hi> why
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169743:63"/>ſhould it not rather be of greater force in the Preſervation of him from it; eſpecially if it be ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied and often reiterated. And ſeeing it is much eaſier to prevent a diſeaſe, then to cure it; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill the Common uſe to throw ſuch as are bitten by a Mad Dog, into the Sea, as well Men, as Beaſts; or elſe into ſome River; and to do the ſame again for ſeveral times. By which repetition of the ſaid practiſe, they ſuppoſe that the <hi>Venom</hi> will be the more eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the Party bitten will alſo be ſo much accuſtomed to the Water, that at length he will not be in any fear of it at all: Which Practiſe (ſay they further) having always continued, even to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, would never have been ſo held up, unleſs the ſpeedy, and often repeated practiſe of the ſame had ſometimes been found to doe ſome good. Which reaſons, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are built upon no ſolid Ground, may eaſily be overthrown. For it is certain, that this <hi>Venom,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:169743:63"/>is not extinguiſhed by the <hi>Water,</hi> nor yet is decocted, and ſpent by length of time; as it too evident, by the miſerable death of very many, who had eaten the boyled fleſh of ſuch Beaſts, as had been bitten by Mad Dogs: as neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Venoms</hi> (for inſtance, that of the <hi>Peſtilence</hi>) can be overma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered by the ſame: but that the <hi>Water</hi> it ſelf is rather infected by the <hi>Venom,</hi> is ſo clear a Truth, as that we need not here ſtand to prove it. And that a <hi>Fiſher</hi> is infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Venom</hi> of the fiſh called <hi>Torpedo,</hi> though it be caſt forth under the Water, the <hi>Proverb</hi> it ſelf, (which ſaith, that, <hi>Piſcator ictus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi>) ſufficiently proves.</p>
            <p>Neither are we ſo well ſatisfied concerning the ſucceſs, in uſing this Remedy, (which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, as the onely Remedy in this caſe, from <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> who was a <hi>Roman,</hi>) as to give any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it: Neither indeed doth he ſpeak of the <hi>Sea</hi> at all, which is very much different from a <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:169743:64"/>For without queſtion, if this Experiment had been made uſe of with happy ſucceſs, either by him, or by any other, it muſt needs have come to the ears of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> who yet affirms, that it was generally acknowledged by thoſe of his Age, that the <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> and the <hi>Knotted Gout,</hi> were Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſeaſes: as he teſtifies in theſe Verſes

And he tells us alſo, that the ſaid <hi>Huntſman,</hi> when he lay upon his Death-bed, was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that the ſame ſhould be communicated to <hi>Fernelius,</hi> who came to ſee him: as is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him, in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Pimpernel</hi> in the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia.</hi>

            <p>And I am very well aſſured, that the Admirable Vertue of this Herb is well known to many people of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169743:67"/>theſe Parts, who to my knowledge have often made uſe of the ſame as of a certain Remedy, when any of their Cattel have been bitten by a <hi>Mad Dog.</hi> And how great Vertue <hi>Rue</hi> is of, both againſt the <hi>Plague,</hi> and other <hi>Peſtilential</hi> Diſeaſes, is ſo well known, as that I need not ſtand to prove it. But that which ſheweth how Incredible force this <hi>Rue</hi> hath in theſe cafes, is, (if we may believe <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi>) that a <hi>VVeeſell,</hi> having firſt but fortified himſelf by eating of <hi>Rue,</hi> is able thereupon to kill a <hi>Baſiliske,</hi> which is the moſt Venomous thing in the world.</p>
            <p>Now the courſe that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Noble Family take in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of this ſo horrid a Malady, is this. So ſoon as ever the Party is bitten, they apply to the Part Affected a large <hi>Cupping-glaſs,</hi> and uſe very deep <hi>Scarifications;</hi> that by this means as much blood may be drawn forth as may be. This being done, they take a Toaſt of <hi>VVhite Bread,</hi> dipped in <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:169743:68"/>&amp; apply it hot upon the Place, and a little while after take it away again; repeating this two or three times, that ſo by the doing of this often, the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> (as I conceave) by drawing forth that of the <hi>Venom,</hi> the <hi>Venom</hi> may by this means be the better fetched forth, and ſucked up by the ſaid Toaſt: and by this means, they ſay, that the VVound becomes to look white. When this is done, they then give the Party every day a pretty big glaſs full of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Decoction,</hi> to the quantity (as I ſuppoſe) of ſix, or ſeven Ounces: which courſe is to be continued for nine days together; onely you muſt abate ſome of the quantity in his Mornings draughts, and his Wound alſo is to be waſhed very clean with the ſaid <hi>Decoction</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtionleſs firſt made warm) and then rubbed with a litle <hi>Oaken</hi> Stick, fitted for that purpoſe, that ſo the Wound may be always kept open, and conſequently may be hindred from healing up. And
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169743:68"/>they think, that during that ſpace of time, there needs no more to be done, but onely that the Party muſt all that while be ſure to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from eating either of <hi>Beans, Peaſe,</hi> or <hi>Hogs-fleſh.</hi> Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I ſhould adviſe, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Party is bitten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the aforeſaid <hi>Cupping-glaſs,</hi> and <hi>Scarifications,</hi> there ſhould be ſome ſtronger <hi>Drawing Medicaments</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Part, then thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of; and that according to the opinion of Authors: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, I ſhould make choice of a Live <hi>Hens Fundament,</hi> rubbed all over with Salt. And I ſhould alſo apply a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> to the Part, and then come to <hi>Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon it; that whatſoever <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom</hi> is yet left behinde, by this continued Application of <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> Medicaments, may the more effectually be drawn forth; as I have more largely ſhewed in my <hi>French Treatiſe,</hi> where I have alſo ſet down ſome Remedies in this Caſe. I muſt needs here adde, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169743:69"/>I know no reaſon, why, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Party is bitten, when the <hi>Cupping-glaſs</hi> is applied, there ſhould <hi>Vineger</hi> alſo be made uſe of: and, if the Wound be very deep, why the <hi>Cupping</hi> of the Part ſhould not be reiterated alſo. But for as much as that what I have here ſpoken touching the effectualneſs of his <hi>Remedy,</hi> and the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that have followed upon the Trial of it, I have received onely but by Relation (though, I confeſs, it was ſuch as I might very well give credit to) and have not at all made experiment of the ſame my ſelf; I ſhall therefore leave the Examination of the ſame to others; neither dare I as yet perſwade any to the Practiſe of it, unleſs where other Convenient Remedies are wanting.</p>

For it is certain, that Almighty God created nothing at all, that, by its Malignity, ſhould tend to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Mankinde, but ſhould rather ſome way or other be uſeful to it; and it is as certain, that even all <hi>Venoms</hi> themſelves were to the ſame end created; as appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, by that of <hi>Vipers,</hi> in the <hi>Preſerving</hi> from, and <hi>Curing</hi> of the <hi>Plague;</hi> where we ſee, one <hi>Poyſon</hi> is an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt another.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall here adde a <hi>Corollary</hi> touching the <hi>Signs,</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169743:71"/>
               <hi>Symptomes</hi> of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
               <note place="margin">None ought to be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the taking of ſome <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotal Medicine,</hi> till ſuch time as the <hi>Principal Symptomes</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> appears.</note> And firſt of all I ſhall adviſe all perſons whatſoever, that they be ſure, that ſo ſoon as ever the Diſeaſe begins to ſpread it ſelf, in the place where they inhabit, they do no neglect the care of themſelves, till ſuch time as the <hi>Principal Symptomes</hi> of it appear upon them; as namely, <hi>Tumors, Carbuncles,</hi> or <hi>Plague-ſores</hi> breaking out upon their bodies. Neither is it at all neceſſary, that the ſeveral <hi>Symptomes</hi> that here concur, ſhould be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivocal,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Party dwells in a houſe, where ſome lye ſick of the Diſeaſe, or perhaps have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of it. But it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warning for him, if he feel but any extraordinary <hi>Chilneſs</hi> about him, or finde himſelf <hi>Feaveriſh,</hi> or have any <hi>Pain</hi> in his <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Loyns,</hi> or any <hi>Heavineſs</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> or be taken with any other ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Diſtemper: nay, although there be no Appearance either of any <hi>Feaver,</hi> or <hi>Blackneſs</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or Extraordinary <hi>Headach,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:169743:72"/>
               <hi>Dizzineſs,</hi> or <hi>Delirium;</hi> (which are not <hi>Eſſentiall Symptomes,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Diſeaſe;) yet muſt not the Party defer the making uſe of ſome <hi>Sudorifical Antidote,</hi> but muſt ſpeedily take one, as ſoon as ever any the leaſt ſign of it begins to appear; leaſt when the Diſeaſe hath taken deeper Root, it either come to late, or perhaps cannot be adminiſtred at all.</p>
            <p>And to the end that thoſe that dwell in houſe that are infected, and ſuch eſpecially as are forced to attend day and night, and be by thoſe that have the Diſeaſe upon them, may be preſerved from this ſo Contagious a Diſeaſe, they ought to take exceeding great heed, and care; that ſo being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unarmed, they may not be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares ſurprized, and ruined by this ſo Treacherous, and Dangerous an Enemy. And firſt of all, I would have them always be chewing of <hi>Angelica Roots, Zedoary, Nutmeg, Cloves, Citron Pill,</hi> or the like, that ſo by this means they may fortifie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169743:72"/>their <hi>Mouth,</hi> againſt the admitting of the <hi>Peſtilential Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there leſs Care to be taken to defend the <hi>Noſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How the <hi>Noſe</hi> is to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> by ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Vineger</hi> (chiefly that which is of a Preſervative Faculty againſt the Plague, and is therefore called by me, <hi>Contrapeſtilential Vineger:</hi>) and you muſt alſo rub the <hi>Noſtrills</hi> over often, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, with a little <hi>Treacle,</hi> or ſome of my <hi>Preſervative</hi> hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; or in defect theſe, you may rub them over with <hi>Rue;</hi> leſt through theſe paſſages, where is a continual Tranſpiration of the Breath, the Malignant Quality of the Contagious Air might (to the evident hazard of the Parties life) be ſuffered to paſs, without any correction at all, to the Heart. And I conceave that theſe Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives are to be preferred far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe other, that are made up with <hi>Musk, Amber,</hi> and the like Odoriferous Ingredients in them; which ſeem rather to pleaſe the <hi>Noſe</hi> with the ſweetnſſe of their

            <p>For the Correcting, or rather Countermanding of which Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Air,<note place="margin">That <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> is very good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the <hi>Plague</hi>
               </note> there are none, I believe, but will confeſs, that to take <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> muſt needs be of very good uſe; eſpecially if it be prepared for this purpoſe, by the mixing of a little <hi>Rue ſeed, Nutmeg,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica root</hi> with it: and ſo the <hi>Smoake</hi> of it be held a pretty while together in the Mouth, before it be blown out at the Noſe; to the end that it may leave behinde it the ſtronger Impreſſion upon thoſe parts, and withal may the more freely diffuſe it ſelf into the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Heart;</hi> that ſo, if it there meet with any Peſtilential Aire, it may either diſſipate, or elſe choak and overmaſter the ſame. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall do very well, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either have a mind, or are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to be with ſuch as are ſick of the <hi>Plague,</hi> that as well before they go in unto the ſick Party, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they come from him, they take
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169743:73"/>a Pipe of the aforeſaid <hi>Tobacco;</hi> while they are taking it, holding the Smoak a good while in their Mouth. For it is probable enough, that where there is a Weak, and light Touch onely of this <hi>Infection,</hi> it may by this means be diſcuſſed, and quite removed: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when ever any one finds that he is certainly infected with it, his beſt way will be to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome <hi>Sudorifical Antidote,</hi> which by its <hi>Specifical Quality</hi> is able to expell, and overmaſter the Peſtilential Air: as we ſee it is in that Compoſition, which they call <hi>Ovum Philoſophorum,</hi> or the <hi>Philoſophers Egge;</hi> and in <hi>Treacle,</hi> and other <hi>Confections</hi> made up with <hi>Vipers Fleſh;</hi> as we know, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Stinging</hi> of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Scorpions,</hi> or, as ſome ſay, the <hi>Powder</hi> of the ſame, is a Sovereign Remedy.</p>
            <p>Neither do I conceave it fit to provide for the defence of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Noſe</hi> onely; but there muſt be care alſo taken of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore my Counſel is, that every morning, the Party be ſure to take a ſpoonful at leaſt of my <hi>Contrapeſtilential Vineger;</hi> or,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169743:74"/>where that cannot be had, two ſpoonfuls of <hi>Wine Vineger;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the greater ſecurity, ſome ſmall quantity of <hi>Rue</hi> hath been ſteeped: and about ſome two hours after he may eat a piece of Bread and Butter, or the like, for his Breakfaſt, and may drink after it a draught of ſtrong <hi>Ale,</hi> or <hi>Wine:</hi> and if there were ſome of the ſaid <hi>Rue,</hi> or <hi>Wormwood</hi> ſteeped in the ſaid Liquors, it would be ſo much the better. Then about two hours before dinner, he muſt take a Dram and a half, at leaſt, of my <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative;</hi> the like quantity whereof he muſt take three hours after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and ſome quantity of it alſo again, before he goes to bed. And he ſhall alſo do very well, if he be conſtantly chewing either of ſome <hi>Angelica Root, Zedoary,</hi> or <hi>Cloves;</hi> which he ſhall do well to take, as ſoon as ever he wakes in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. He muſt alſo waſh his mouth with <hi>Vineger;</hi> that ſo, in caſe any <hi>Contagious Aire</hi> ſhould lurk about his Chamber, or ſhould by any
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169743:75"/>body be brought in thither, he may not draw it into his body uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. For, as Cities that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, or lye not far from an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, are to be defended, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Trenches, Walls, and a continual Guard of Souldiers; in like manner are we, night and day, without the leaſt intermiſſion at all to ſtand upon our Guard, and fortifie our ſelves againſt this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Diſeaſe, by making uſe of <hi>Antidotal Medicaments;</hi> that ſo none of its <hi>Venom</hi> may be receaved into our bodis but what is firſt ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and deprived of its Venomous Weapons. And therefore the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may take a little quantity of my <hi>Preſervative,</hi> (the Diſcription whereof here followeth) and may hold it in his mouth, and now and then ſwallow ſome of it down; beſides that which he is to take of it, at ſome certaine appointed times.</p>

               <p>And indeed I have been always very deſirous, that thoſe, that live in any ſo Contagious, and Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial an Air, ſhould be ſure exactly to obſerve the Rules that I have here laid down. And although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe Rules have not been ſo exactly obſerved as I would have them, (which is a thing likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) yet that they have done very much good, where they have been obſerved but in part, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficiently, by the large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of thoſe that have been preſerved hereby, mentioned both in my <hi>French Treatiſe,</hi> and in this alſo. For, thoſe perſons I ſpeak of, although they had never been before accuſtomed to this <hi>Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Aire,</hi> nor had ever been with ſuch as had had the diſeaſe upon them, nor themſelves had ever formerly been viſited with the ſame; by being armed with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Antidotes,</hi> they have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended continually, both night and day, upon thoſe that have had the diſeaſe upon them,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169743:76"/>and have not been at at all touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ſo dangerous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious a diſeaſe. As, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, very many of their friends, who came very often into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſome alſo that dwelt in the ſame houſes with them, have gone cleare without any Infection. All which things, although they were preſcribed, and appointed by me when I was not in preſence with the Sick Perſons, (for, I confeſs, I ſeldom ſee them, but for the moſt part refuſe to do ſo) yet by my moſt diligent inquirie about theſe things, and by the confeſſion of thoſe many perſons themſelves, that have been by this means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as alſo by the relation of others too, that have given me a very particular account of all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I am ſo well aſſured of the efficacy of the ſame in theſe Caſes, as that, I conceave, no man ought to doubt thereof.</p>
               <p>Which alſo can be atteſted to by the Monks of the Abbies in <hi>Gaunt:</hi> for when the ſaid diſeaſe had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169743:77"/>into the Abby of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> there, and that the ſecond time too; thoſe ſervants that attended upon the Sick Perſons of ſaid Abby, though they had never been before accuſtomed to this <hi>Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Aire,</hi> by arming themſelves with theſe <hi>Preſervatives</hi> onely (yet without any Counſel of mine) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured, upon the ſtrength of the ſame, to attend continually upon thoſe that were ſick of the diſeaſe. And to inſtance in ſome, Maſter <hi>Crombruggen,</hi> who was there the <hi>Prior;</hi> and another, that had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Confeſſion, were both ſeized upon (themſelves not at all ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ſame) by this Cloſe and Dangerous Diſeaſe; againſt which, having not made uſe of any <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives,</hi> they both died, in the year of the Lord 1634. whom a third perſon alſo followed, in the year 1636. And the ſame ſervants after their deceaſe, aired and purged their Chambers, and the things that were in them, all the ways they could imagine; neither did any of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169743:77"/>them then, nor hath any other ſince miſcarried out of the ſaith Abby, or hath had the leaſt Touch of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And about the ſam tim, in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of <hi>Baudeloo:</hi> which two Abbies were far enough diſtant from each other, there being two of the ſaid Abby infected with the Plague, one of which died the very next day after he had been taken with the ſame, and the other alſo, after he had lain ſix days ſick of the ſaid diſeaſe, at length died Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; yet for all this, none of the reſt of the Convent, although they had never been before themſelves ſick of it, or had come near to ſuch as were infected, truſting to the Vertue of theſe <hi>Preſervatives</hi> here ſet down, and preſuming the more, by the Charitableneſs of the Office, adventured to be preſent with, and willingly to attend upon thoſe that were ſick: and this they did, without receiving any Prejudice at all to their own health thereby, or any ſpreading and carrying it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169743:78"/>abroad to others they kept compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with.</p>
               <p>So likwiſe in the Abby of <hi>Tonger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo,</hi> one <hi>Antonius Kirckovius,</hi> who was a Frier there, being a man of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong Conſtitution, and in the flower of his age, in the year 1634. was taken ſuddenly with a great <hi>Sadneſs of Heart, Vomiting,</hi> a <hi>Feaver,</hi> and <hi>Headach;</hi> and finding the third day of his ſickneſs a hard <hi>Tumor</hi> riſen under his left Arme-pit, and having three Plague-ſores broken out upon the Region of the <hi>Heart,</hi> he preſently ſends for a Surgeon; who being come, and having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and conſidered of all the ſeveral Symptomes, his opinion was, that the Party could hardly live till the next day. In the mean time the ſick perſon ſends to me, (for I came not to him) deſiring earneſtly of me, that I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him ſomething for his Cure. But becauſe than I conceaved him to be no better now then a dead man, I though good to make uſe of <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi> rather then of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169743:78"/>Medicaments,</hi> which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here to come too late. Yet I preſcribed him to take a double Doſe of the <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative:</hi> by means whereof after he had ſweated ſo extreamly, as that not onely all his Bed, and Bed-cloathes were wet through, but that the ſweat ran down through the ſame alſo upon the ground, running down in ſo great a quantity in manner of a little ſtream, as it were; ſo than both his <hi>Headach, Feaver,</hi> and conſequently the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid hard <hi>Tumor,</hi> and <hi>Plague-ſores</hi> by little and little alſo vaniſhed, and the Party within a few days after had now been reſtored again to his perfect health; The <hi>Prior</hi> of the ſaid Abby, with another of the Friers, named <hi>Poret,</hi> ſuppoſing, by reaſon of the ſo ſuddain recovery of this man, that there was no danger of the Plague at all, they preſently adventured to give him a viſit. Which as ſoon as ever I heard of, I preſently took care to ſend them ſome <hi>Preſervatives;</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169743:79"/>my ſelf, that they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be infected by ſo Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and Contagious an Aire, as they went into: as indeed the <hi>Prior</hi> was; who the next day after was taken with ſo great a <hi>Heavineſs</hi> at his <hi>Heart,</hi> and with a <hi>Headach, Swimming</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> and a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> as that he could hardly ſtand upon his Legs. Well then; what was now to be done? Why thus: Immediately, he takes his <hi>Sudorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preſervative,</hi> as I had appointed him, ſo ſoon as ever he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ill; and, after he had ſweat for the ſpace of four hours by a great fire, finding himſelf very much refreſhed, and as he thought, quite freed from his diſeaſe; he gets up, and would needs preſently go to his Bed-Chamber: where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome certain hours ſpace find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf ſome Relicks of the Contagion, which began to bring upon him again the aforeſaid Symptomes which he had felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he betakes himſelf preſently to his former Practiſe again; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169743:79"/>getting a good fire made him: he immediately falls to make uſe of his <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative;</hi> and ſo by this means perfectly at length cured hfmſelf. But <hi>Poret,</hi> his Brother-Frier, who had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his <hi>Preſervatives,</hi> and had taken no <hi>Antidotal Medicine</hi> at all againſt the Diſeaſe ſo ſoon as ever he felt it upon him; and preſently a <hi>Swelling</hi> riſen in his <hi>Groyne:</hi> yet by applying ſuch Convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as the preſent Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, he was perfectly cured, (nor was any other perſon infected by him;) and in this perfect ſtate of health he continues to this very day. And by making uſe of the aforeſaid means of <hi>Preſervation,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, both Friers and Nunnes, and others alſo in many other houſes, both of Eminent Perſons, and of thoſe of meaner note alſo, have been ſo ſtrangely preſerved from this diſeaſe, as that I have thought fit rather to paſs ſome of them over in Silence, then here to make mention of them: as neither
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169743:80"/>have I ſpoken of them in my <hi>French Treatiſe;</hi> leaſt in ſo doing, I might be thought to attribute too much to this my manner of Practiſe. In like manner, as in the aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſtory of the Cure of <hi>Kerc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius,</hi> I have not mentioned at all what he himſelf affirmed to me and his Brother-Friers; namely, that when he was in thoſe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <hi>Sweats,</hi> he ſaw plainly the <hi>Tokens</hi> appearing all about his Armes, and yet had at the ſame time both his <hi>underſtanding</hi> and his <hi>Eye-ſight</hi> perfect. Which Happineſs though it very ſeldome befall thoſe that are fick of the Plague; yet I am very certain, that the ſame hath very often happened to ſeveral Patients of mine, (and yet thoſe that were frequently with them, have not been infected therewith at all;) who having taken my <hi>Preſervative,</hi> the ſecret Venom hath been driven out from within, to the outward parts of the Body; as the <hi>Purple Spots</hi> appearing always upon their Skin did evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:169743:80"/>
               <p>And, which amongſt the reſt may ſeem to be a moſt Incredible ſtory, when the Abbeſs of <hi>Ooſtecloy,</hi> in the year 1634. lay deſperately ſick of the Plague, (for ſhe had a <hi>Plague-ſore</hi> broken out under her Chin, and a <hi>Swelling</hi> riſen under her left Arme-pit, and her Tongue was all over Black, and Swollen, and Spots of the ſame colour appeared all over her body, which are all Evident ſigns of the ſame, (the now Abbeſs, (that after ward ſucceeded her in her place, together with three other Nunnes, neither of which had ever before been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to any ſuch Peſtilential Aire, nor had ever been ſick of the ſaid diſeaſe; yet for all this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended night and day upon her, and that too in a very little Chamber; and would needs, though impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and to no purpoſe (for ſhe was no better then a dead Woman, in the judgement of all people) perform that deed of Charity, even deſcending to the moſt ſordid and courſe Offices; onely preſuming
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169743:81"/>upon the Vertue of my <hi>Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi> of <hi>Health</hi> in this caſe preſcribed them; although I confeſs I diſſwaded them from ſo doing. And yet they all four (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet alive to this day) by the ſingular mercy of God, have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reſt of that whole houſe, continued all hitherto clear, and free from any the leaſt touch of Infection; ſave onely one <hi>Lay Siſter</hi> of the ſaid Nunnery, who died the day before the Abbeſs her Miſtreſs, whom ſhe had infected, coming newly to her from a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of hers that lay ſick of the Plague. Yet notwithſtanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe things, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, have ſucceeded ſo according to my wiſh, and beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; Yet ſhall I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any one that hath not been accuſtomed to this Contagious Aire, and perhaps is uncapable of receaving my Inſtructions, or when this Venomous diſeaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth more then ordinary, to expoſe himſelf to the inevitable danger of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169743:81"/>the ſame: conceaving it ſufficient for me, that I have been able to give a faithful account of many more that have in this caſe been happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved, then that have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried; and that the <hi>Preſervatives</hi> that I have in this diſeaſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, have been found to be of ſo great Efficacy, and Vertue, as that thoſe that are neceſſitated to be preſent which ſuch as are ſick of the diſeaſe, or elſe ſhall have a minde to viſite their friends, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, may without any fear (for there is no <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> more dangerous in this caſe, then that of <hi>Fear,</hi>) perform this Act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For, this Peſtilential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion is very apt to ſeize upon ſuch as are either ſtricken with fear, or dejected by grief. To the end therefore, that by reaſon of theſe, and the like Paſſions, people may not be ſo much the apter to receave and take in this Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Venom; they may ſometimes refreſh themſelves by drinking Wine, in a greater quantity then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169743:82"/>uſuall, and even to ſome good height of Mirth, provided that it be not to drunkenneſs:) or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Wine, they may take good ſtrong <hi>Ale,</hi> that is Stale, and clear.</p>

Or if they would provide yet more certainly for their own ſafety, the beſt <hi>Preſervative</hi> that is, in this caſe, is ſaid to be that <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> which is compounded of <hi>Three Adverbs,</hi> which are theſe, <hi>Citò Longè, Tardè</hi> Signifying, A <hi>Speedy flight</hi> from the Infected place; A <hi>Far diſtant Habitation;</hi> and A <hi>Slow return,</hi> to it again. But for as much as this cannot always be done, thoſe that muſt ſtay upon the place, may provide for their own ſafety by making uſe of thoſe <hi>Maſtications,</hi> before ſet down, for the defence of their <hi>Mouth;</hi> as they muſt do for their <hi>Noſe,</hi> by ſmelling to <hi>Vineger,</hi> and for their <hi>Stomack,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Confections,</hi> as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed for ſuch, as either

               <p>And thoſe alſo, that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently fly away, and leave the place Infected, may yet do very well to take with them ſome of the <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative;</hi> that ſo in caſe they ſhould chance, either in their journey, or elſe at the place where they intend to ſettle, to find the leaſt Touch of <hi>Infection</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them; by <hi>Sweating</hi> lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, they may quite expel the <hi>Venom</hi> of the Diſeaſe; which is moſt certainly known ſometimes to lurk for ſome pretty while in the

               <p>I ſhall here ſpeak ſomething, touching what <hi>Meat</hi> is in this caſe to be eaten, and what to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne. In <hi>Contagious</hi> times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore people muſt abſtaine from <hi>Hogs-Fleſh, Beefe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of <hi>Meat.</hi>
                  </note> and all other kinds of fleſh that are Hard of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, as alſo from all <hi>Inwards</hi> and <hi>Extream Parts</hi> of Beaſts, as <hi>Feet, Ears,</hi>  And ſo likewiſe from all <hi>Slimy Fiſhes,</hi> all kinde of <hi>Pulſe, Herbs,</hi> and from all <hi>White Meats,</hi> or things made of <hi>Milke,</hi> Except onely <hi>Butter.</hi> And ſo, on the contrary, they are to make choice of all ſuch <hi>Meats,</hi> as are light of Digeſtion; and withal, they muſt abſtain from <hi>Fiſh,</hi> when they eat <hi>Fleſh;</hi> which alſo they are to eat rather <hi>Roſted,</hi> then <hi>Boyled:</hi> and if they will have them boyled in any Liquor, or make <hi>Broth</hi> of the ſame; they may put into it a little <hi>Wine Vineger, Juyce of Citron, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg, Cloves,</hi> or the like; or ſome <hi>Sweet Herbs,</hi> prepared according to the quality of their Meat; which will not onely be very pleaſant to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169743:87"/>their Palate, but alſo do them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe very much good.</p>
               <p>Hitherto is to be referred alſo a certain <hi>Sauſe,</hi> which I would have them always to have at their table; and it is made of <hi>Wine-Vineger, Nutmeg,</hi> and <hi>Sugar;</hi> boyled in <hi>Broath:</hi> (or in defect of this, they may take <hi>Wine</hi> with <hi>Butter</hi> in it,) which yet muſt be ſo prepared, as that the taſt of the <hi>Vineger,</hi> and of the <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> may be above all the reſt. And in this <hi>Sauſe,</hi> I would have them to roule all over, and lay a ſoaking all meat whatſoever that they eat; or elſe, they may take, at the end of their Meale, a ſpoonful or two of it, and ſup it up. Thoſe that are <hi>Aſthmaticall,</hi> or <hi>Short-breathed;</hi> or are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Tyſſicall,</hi> and troubled with a <hi>Cough,</hi> muſt put the leſſer quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Vineger,</hi> and the greater of <hi>Sugar,</hi> into this Compoſition: as likewiſe in uſing the <hi>Contrapeſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Vineger,</hi> they muſt either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct or infuſe in it ſome <hi>Figs, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Liquoriſh,</hi> or other the like
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169743:87"/>
                  <hi>Pectorall</hi> Ingredients; and if their Cough be very ſtrong upon them; inſtead of <hi>Vineger,</hi> they may then uſe ſome other Preſervatives: in like manner as thoſe that are <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropicall,</hi> ſhould every morning drink a good draught of <hi>Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Wine,</hi> or <hi>Rue-Wine,</hi> rather then a ſpoonful of <hi>Contrapeſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Vineger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning their <hi>Ordinary Drink,</hi> my Opinion is, that they may take the ſame that they have been accuſtomed unto,<note place="margin">Of their Ordinary <hi>Drink.</hi>
                  </note> whether it be <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Beer,</hi> or <hi>Ale:</hi> into which nevertheleſs I would have them ſomtimes ſqueeze in ſome few drops of <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Citron,</hi> or of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Brimſtone:</hi> and the <hi>Ale</hi> they drink muſt be cleare, and not ſtrong; as their <hi>Wine</hi> alſo muſt not be of the richer ſort, but muſt be either <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wine,</hi> or Ordinary <hi>French Wine;</hi> wherein they may do well to put ſometimes a little boyled <hi>Water,</hi> with a ſmall quantity of <hi>Citron Pill,</hi> or <hi>Cinnamon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it ſo fall out, that any
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169743:88"/>one hath either been in company with thoſe that have been infected,<note place="margin">In the leſt ſuſpicion of being infected, they muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly fly to their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives.</hi>
                  </note> or that have been with ſuch as have been with ſuch as have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to attend upon ſuch as have had the diſeaſe upon them, (which can hardly be without a ſtrong ſuſpicion, if not a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being infected by this Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,) and eſpecially, when he hath not before hand armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt it by <hi>Preſervatives</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Party finde no ſign of it at all about himſelf) yet my adviſe is, that he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betake himſelf to <hi>Sudorifical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> and take two Drams of <hi>Old Treacle,</hi> mixed with a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Wine-Vineger;</hi> and drinke upon it two or three ſpoonfulls of the ſaid <hi>Vineger,</hi> warmed.</p>
               <p>Now to the end that people may know, (where the ſigns of the Plague do evidently appear,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cure of it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with any hopes of recovery of the Patient; I ſhall here breifly ſet down ſuch things as ſeem chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169743:88"/>to relate to the <hi>Predictions</hi> in this caſe. And firſt of all I conceave,<note place="margin">Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that very good ſucceſs may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if ſo be the aforemention-<hi>Preſervative</hi> be taken at the very beginning of the Diſeaſe, and that the Party keep it; ſo that he may thereby Sweat luſtily, in caſe that any <hi>Plague-Sores,</hi> and <hi>Swellings</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, before he feels any <hi>Feaveriſh Heat.</hi> And although this Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy flatter us thus and thus, yet that we are by no means to truſt him, Sad Experience hath too often taught us. And if the Party be taken with a Continuall <hi>Vomiting,</hi> and be extreamly <hi>Sleepy,</hi> and have a very <hi>Stinking Breath,</hi> or the <hi>Tongue</hi> be <hi>Black,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe; it is a ſign, that the danger is very great: and ſo likewiſe if the Patient have an <hi>Intermitting Pulſe,</hi> or <hi>Swooning Fits,</hi> or a <hi>Looſeneſs,</hi> or where there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a <hi>Bleeding</hi> at the <hi>Noſe,</hi> or an unſeaſonable Eruption of the <hi>Courſes:</hi> and eſpecially if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have a <hi>Hoarſneſs:</hi> or if his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:169743:89"/>and <hi>Excrements,</hi> and what he throws up by <hi>Vomit,</hi> be black; or he be taken with the <hi>Hickop,</hi> or a <hi>Trembling</hi> in his <hi>Limbs;</hi> or if he ſpit Blood, or piſſe Blood; are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident ſigns of Death.</p>
               <p>And if, as I have formerly ſaid, it is very Neceſſary, that where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one hath but the leaſt ſuſpicion of being infected, he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently have recourſe to <hi>Sudorifical Preſervatives;</hi> there is no queſtion, but ſuch, as finde any real ſign that they are already Infected, ought to fly unto the ſame, as to a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary;</hi> and that too, at the very Inſtant that they diſcover the ſame, (ſeeing the Diſeaſe may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtred much eaſier, then the people imagine, if it be taken in time) leſt when theſe aforeſaid Fatall <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> appear, there be no hope of Recovery left. And this <hi>Preſervative</hi> the Patient is to take with <hi>Vineger,</hi> (as hath before been ſhewed,) and in his Bed, being well covered with Cloathes, and with a good fire by him, if it may

And he is to ſweat as long as poſſibly he can; and if the <hi>Sweat</hi> come not from him in very great Abundance, (which in this caſe is very Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) he muſt then have a <hi>Bladder</hi> half filled with <hi>Warme Water,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to his <hi>Belly;</hi> in which if there be decocted ſome leaves of <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Rue,</hi> or <hi>Angelica Roots,</hi> or <hi>Zedoary,</hi> there may much the better ſucceſs be expected. And if ſo be the Party ſweat not enough nor grow the better upon it; he muſt preſently, (as ſoon as he hath ſomething recovered his ſtrength a little,) fall again to his <hi>Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the ſecond time; yea, and ſometimes alſo there is very good reaſon that he ſweat the third time too: Which Reiteration of <hi>Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> notwithſtanding is very often not at all Neceſſary, in caſe that the <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative,</hi> being taken in the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, hath wrought abundantly enough, Concerning the Efficacy of which Timely <hi>Sweating,</hi> in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169743:90"/>beginning of this Diſeaſe, <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> alſo hath given us a large Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>De febribus, Cap,</hi> 6. where he hath theſe words. <hi>Exiſtimo tot homines peſte interire, quòd plerique tardiùs Alexipharmaca uſurpant; multoſque poſſe ſervari, ſi ea citius, &amp; antequam venenum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores corrumpere incipit, aſſumerent.

I am of Opinion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the reaſon why ſo many die of the</hi> Plague, <hi>is, becauſe they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the time too long, before they take any</hi> Preſervatives, <hi>and that many might ſcape, if they had but had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſame, before the Venom of the diſeaſe had begun to corrupt the Humors. For, I have ſeveral times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169743:90"/>that, in a Peſtilential ſeaſon, ſome, that have found themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, preſently betaking themſelves to</hi> Sudorificall Preſervatives, <hi>and ſweating thereupon, have immediatly freed themſelves utterly from the ſame; and the next day after have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſs again. Whereas, on the Contrary, where the Endeavors for Cure have been deferred, and put off for a matter of eight or nine hours, without the taking of any</hi> Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>there is ſcarſely one of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that hath ſcaped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Ordinary Doſe of this <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative,</hi> is, A Dram and a half of the <hi>Philoſophers, Egge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Quantity of the <hi>Sudorifical Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> that is to be taken.</note> one Scruple of <hi>Confection</hi> of <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth,</hi> ſix Graines of <hi>Oriental Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar,</hi> or ten Graines of <hi>Bezoar</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> and five drops of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur:</hi> Mix theſe together, and take it in a Spoonful of Warm <hi>Vineger,</hi> (as hath before been ſhewed) and drink upon it three other ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of <hi>Veneger</hi> Warmed. And in defect of the <hi>Philoſophers Egge,</hi> they may take two Drams and a half of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169743:91"/>
                  <hi>Old Treacle,</hi> and half a Dram of <hi>Confection</hi> of <hi>Hyacinth:</hi> and in ſtead of <hi>Bezoar Stone,</hi> where the people are poor, they may take ſome Grains of the Shavings of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns Horn. Extracts,</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> which are made out of <hi>Scordium, Rue, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> are uſed by many in this caſe, taken to the quantity of about a Dram. The ſpirit of <hi>Antimony</hi> alſo, ſo prepared, as that it may neither cauſe <hi>Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> nor <hi>Going</hi> to <hi>Stoole,</hi> but may provoke <hi>Sweating</hi> onely, is here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much commended: in which, as in the former <hi>Extracts,</hi> we may have much the greater Confidence, if it be given with a little <hi>Warme Vineger,</hi> and a Dram of <hi>Old Treacle</hi> at the leaſt; leſt that part of the Medicine, which is principally <hi>Antidotal,</hi> (as <hi>Vipers Fleſh</hi> is here) ſhould be wanting. And for this cauſe I chiefly prefer the aforeſaid <hi>Preſervatives</hi> Which alſo may be adminiſtred in a greater quantity, where the ſtrength of the Venom requires the ſame: and therefore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169743:95"/>in this caſe they may take two Drams of the <hi>Philoſophers Egge,</hi> or three Drams of <hi>Old Treacle,</hi> with the other preſcribed Ingredients: in like manner as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and other ancient Authors, were wont to preſcribe half an Ounce of <hi>Treacle;</hi> and in caſe that were not ſufficient to expel the Poyſon, then they appointed the ſame to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, preſcribing either the ſame, or a leſs quantity, according to the Conſtitution of the Patient.</p>
               <p>And I know beſides that at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> in the year 1647. this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative was adminiſtred by Mr. <hi>Cortreau,</hi> a Jeſuite, to another of the ſame Fraternity, (who had a <hi>Tumor</hi> riſen under his Left Arme-Pit, and two <hi>Plague-Sores</hi> broke out in other places,) whom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of twenty hours, he cauſed to take an Ounce and a half of <hi>Treacle;</hi> namely the firſt time he gave him Two Drams, and eight hours after half an Ounce, and after the ſpace of other eight hours ſix Drams more, drinking
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169743:96"/>after each ſeveral Doſe a luſty draught, or two, of Water of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus,</hi> and the like, with ſuch Syrups as are proper in this caſe; in the mean time not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the reparation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtrength, by convenient, and proper Meats. About the ſame time, during the raging of the Peſtilence there, a Surgeon belonging to the Peſt-houſe gave to one that was ſick of the Plague, (and that with very good ſucceſs too) half an Ounce of <hi>Treacle:</hi> with Quantity of the ſaid <hi>Preſervative</hi> ſeems much more proper to be adminiſtred at the firſt, where the diſeaſe appears Evidently upon the Party, then two Drams onely; for this quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity may ſuffice, in the beginning of the diſeaſe: Although I ſhall not adviſe any to take ſo great a quantity, nor yet an ordinary one, when the Party Affected is very drowzy, and given to ſleep: in which caſe ſome other <hi>Sudorifical</hi> Medicines may be adminiſtr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:169743:94"/>
               <p>And I have alſo heard, from Perſons of very good credit, that both in this, and other diſeaſes too, they have cauſed their Patients to ſweat in a very abundant quantity (and with very happy ſucceſs) by adminiſtring to them half a Dram of the <hi>Powder</hi> of a <hi>Viper;</hi> which is thus prepared. You muſt take a <hi>Viper,</hi> and put it in whole, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, with its head, teeth, tailè, and bowels too, into an Earthen Pot, covered at the top; in which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there muſt be ſome holes made for Evaporation, and thus you are to ſet it upon live Coals, ſo that it may only be dried, &amp; not ſcortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and this being ſo prepared may, as occaſion ſhal require, be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Powder,</hi> and be adminiſtred (as other things are to be, and as I have more largely related in my <hi>French Treatiſe</hi>) with <hi>Vineger,</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And it would not be amiſs, if one ſhould adde to this a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Sudorifical Antimony,</hi> as half a Dram thereof; or elſe ſome few Graines of <hi>Bezoar.</hi> And where
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169743:95"/>theſe things are not to be had, they may take five Ounces of <hi>Wine-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger</hi> warmed, with a Dram of <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> and a Scruple of <hi>Saffron,</hi> and put them into a Bladder half full of warme Water, and ſo apply it to the Lower part of the Belly: continuing this Application ſo long, till ſuch time as ſome other <hi>Preſervative</hi> Medicine, that may be able (if need be) to cauſe the Party to <hi>Sweat</hi> in ſo great a quantity, as in neceſſary, may be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>And for as much as, where the Patient is to <hi>Sweat</hi> in ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, (as in this diſeaſe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite,) his Shirt and his Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen about him, muſt neceſſarily be very Wet; and therefore Authors conceave, (and reaſonably enough) that theſe being as certain <hi>Recapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the <hi>Venom,</hi> ought to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; that ſo the Patient may be freed from the filthy Stench, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lyes wrapped up; yet I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all people, that they ſhould not be too raſh in changing the ſick
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169743:91"/>Parties <hi>Linnen;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Shirts, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen about him is not to be changed unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly</note> but ſhould rather wipe off the Sweat from them with Towels, which are not freſh, and newly taken out of the Cheſt; but being firſt ſprinkled over with ſome ſweet Water, have afterwards been very well aired by the fire, till ſuch time, as that all the ſmell of the <hi>Sope,</hi> or what other Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſmell ſoever, be quite driven out. And I have been confirmed in my Opinion of the dangerouſneſs of applying <hi>Freſh Linnen</hi> to People in this caſe, both by the common voyce of the People, and alſo by thoſe that have belonged to <hi>Peſt-houſes,</hi> and ſuch as have otherwiſe attended upon Perſons that have been ſick of the Plague; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of whom will not ſuffer the ſick Party to change his <hi>Linnen,</hi> (not in this diſeaſe onely, but in the <hi>Small Pox</hi> alſo) but will have him either keep on the ſame, or if he do ſhift) he muſt put on either what himſelf formerly wore, in the time of his health: or what have bin worne by ſome of his Healthfull
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169743:92"/>Freinds; and thoſe muſt be verie well aired too firſt by the fire. It hath alſo been obſerved, that by <hi>Shifting</hi> of <hi>Linnen</hi> (I mean of that next the Skin) the <hi>Courſes</hi> in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which in this caſe are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and the <hi>Hemorrhoids</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have been otherwiſe in good health, have broken forth. Which putting on of <hi>Freſh Linnen,</hi> before the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, how extream Dangerous it is, and indeed how Inſufferable (unleſs the Party, impatient of the Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmell about himſelf, will needs ſhift his Shirt, and put on one that had been worn before) is moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and ſeriouſly preſſed by <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandus Diemerbrouc,</hi> in his <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations:</hi> where he tells us of ſome, that having heedleſly put on <hi>Freſh Linnen</hi> in this diſeaſe, within a few hours after they have been taken with a <hi>Feavouriſh Heat,</hi> a <hi>Heavineſs of Heart,</hi> and other the like Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, which have grown ſo ſtrongly upon them, as that they haue been brought even to deaths
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169743:92"/>doore; none of which things have happened, where the Parties have put on ſuch <hi>Linnen</hi> as had been worne before; in which the <hi>Smell</hi> of the <hi>Sope</hi> hath been diſſipated by the heat of the Body; which is much more to be feared, then that <hi>Stink</hi> which comes from <hi>Foule Linnen;</hi> as by moſt certain <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> hath very often been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: To which we ought to give greater credit (eſpecially in ſuch matters as concern this ſo <hi>Occult,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Stink of <hi>Sope</hi> is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, not onely for thoſe that are Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but for thoſe that are in health too, in the time of the Plague.</note> and <hi>Dark Diſeaſe</hi>) then to <hi>Reaſon:</hi> ſeeing that we know, that thoſe that are free from infection, and do live in houſes that are ſo too, yet by having their Linnen waſhed with <hi>Sope,</hi> are much more apt to take the Infection of this Peſtilentiall Aire, then otherwiſe they would have been, if they had not ſuffered the other to come near them: which is ſo certainly known to be true, as that I need not ſtand here to prove it.</p>
               <p>And to the end that there may be the more ſure means uſed for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169743:93"/>Prevention of this moſt Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Raging Diſeaſe; there ought to be very great care taken for the repairing of the ſtrength of the Patient; which is to be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored preſently after his <hi>Sweating,</hi> and at other ſet times,<note place="margin">What Meats are allowed in the <hi>Plague.</hi>
                  </note> by giving him ſuch meats, as either his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the Feavoriſhneſs of his Temper will require, and his Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous Stomack will admit. Which, ſeeing it is not to be overloaded with Fleſh, muſt be cheriſhed up with <hi>Broaths, Juyces Expreſſed,</hi> and <hi>Reſtorative Gellies</hi> made thereof; to which you may adde ſome <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Citron,</hi> or ſome <hi>Verdjuyce.</hi> And to the end that his Weak Stomack may not caſt the ſame up again, he may do well to take a ſlice of <hi>Pome-Citron,</hi> with the Pill taken off, and rouled firſt in a little Sugar.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> This man, who was a moſt diligent Viſiter of Perſons that were infected, when the <hi>Plague</hi> was at <hi>Nimmengen,</hi> (as <hi>Palmarius</hi> in the like manner was, when it was at <hi>Paris</hi>) and withall a moſt Exact Obſerver of all things whatſoever related either to the underſtanding of the Diſeaſe, or the Cure of it; at what time the Plague raged there moſt furiouſly, in the year <hi>1636, &amp; 1637;</hi> in his Book which he put forth in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169743:101"/>ſaid year <hi>1637,</hi> by moſt ſtrong Reaſons, and the ſame confirmed alſo by Experience, proves, that in the <hi>Plague,</hi> people are altogether to forbear both from <hi>Letting</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> and from taking of <hi>Purges,</hi> or <hi>Vomits;</hi> giving there very good Reaſons why the ſame ought not to be admitted; and giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count alſo of the bad ſucceſs that others had had, when they had preſcribed the ſame to their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: where alſo he further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that of a very great number of Infected people, ſcarſe any one that had been let <hi>Blood,</hi> recovered: and, which is yet much more ſtrange, He, together with <hi>Riverius,</hi> and <hi>Lidderius,</hi> obſerved, that <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> was not onely dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, in perſons that had the <hi>Plague</hi> upon them, but that it was unſafe alſo for thoſe that were in health, in the time of the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> (unleſs there were otherwiſe very great Neceſſity of doing ſo,) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon the ſame, by way of <hi>Preſervation</hi> from this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:169743:97"/>
               <p>When I conſidered, that this difference of judgement among Authors, in this ſo Hazardous, and Weighty a buſineſs, produced nothing but Doubtfulneſs in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and Injury to their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; I thought fit to treat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the more largely of this point, in this my Short and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Treatiſe; that ſo I might hint to thoſe, that are ſo very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in maintaining that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Evacuations</hi> are in this caſe of very good Uſe, that they would not think much, before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame, to enquire, and and inform themſelves ſufficiently, what the ſucceſs hath hitherto been, where the ſame have been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for as much as, in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſes, the beſt judgement is to be made from ſuch things as are either Good, or Hurtful to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. And if they will but vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to do this, they will queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs finde that the greateſt part of thoſe, that have admitted of the ſaid <hi>Evacuations,</hi> have miſcarried,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169743:98"/>and that very few have in this caſe eſcaped; and, that if they did, it was rather to be attributed to the ſtrength of their own conſtitutions, or elſe to the weakneſs of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> then to any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Now in caſe that leaving, and rejecting the ſaid <hi>Evacuations,</hi> the Sick Party ſhall have recourſe to <hi>Sudorifical Preſervatives,</hi> and that theſe do not prove to be able quite to expel the Venom of the Diſeaſe through the Outmoſt Parts of the Body, but that either by means of their force, or elſe of its own accord it breaks out into <hi>Tumors,</hi> and <hi>Carbuncles</hi> upon the Body; there muſt then ſome <hi>Attractive,</hi> and <hi>Concoctive</hi> Medicines be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Part Affected, for the drawing forth of the <hi>Venomous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> lying in the ſaid part; which yet muſt not be brought to perfect <hi>Maturation;</hi> as indeed it cannot be: neither, if it could, would it be ſafe to admit of ſo much delay.

There are ſome that, in this caſe, apply nothing to the Part Affected, ſave <hi>Roſted Onyons,</hi> mixed with <hi>Freſh Butter,</hi> or <hi>Oyle</hi> of <hi>Lillies.</hi> Many have with very good ſucceſs made uſe here of a <hi>Hens Fundament,</hi> having
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169743:97"/>the feathers pulled off, and then being rubbed over with Salt, and ſo applied to the part for a good while together, and when the firſt Hen was dead, they applied another, as long as the Patient was able to endure it: and the Bills of the ſaid Hens they held ſomtime faſt ſhut up. When they had thus done, they then fell again to make uſe of the aforeſaid <hi>Oyntments,</hi> and <hi>Cataplaſmes;</hi> untill ſuch time as that the <hi>Tumor</hi> being brought to a ſufficient <hi>Suppuration,</hi> it might be lanced with an Inſtrument, to let out the <hi>Purulent Matter:</hi> which yet if the Hardneſs of the <hi>Tumor</hi> will not admit, you muſt make uſe of a <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> to draw it forth.

               <p>In the curing of a <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> or <hi>Plague Sore,</hi> they make uſe of the like <hi>Oyls</hi> and <hi>Plaſters;</hi> which yet are ordinarily made not quite ſo ſtrong, and drawing; leaſt, being ſo ſtrong, they might too much exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the ſame. And you are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to proceedin the cureof this, as of al other Sores, til it be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed up.

               <p>As concerning the Cure of the <hi>Tokens,</hi> as they call them, which are <hi>Dark Purple Spots,</hi> or of the like colour, appearing upon the Skin in Peſtilential Diſeaſes, I ſhall not ſay anything here, having ſaid ſo much of this point in my <hi>French Treatiſe;</hi> leaſt by doing the ſame

                  <hi>Rheniſh Wine,</hi> or ſome other ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſort of Wine; in caſe a <hi>Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or elſe the greateſt of the <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voriſh Heat</hi> he is in, hinder not the ſame.

Yea the whole, <hi>Pome-Citron</hi> alſo, taken with its Pill and Kernels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (both which are alſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls) and ſo cut in pieces, may very properly be put into his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Drinks,</p>
               <p>Now how the Impure, filthy Stenches of ſuch houſes as have been infected, are to be cleanſed, and waſhed away with Water, which would do better if it were mixed with <hi>Vineger</hi> or with <hi>Rue</hi> boyled in it, and hot alſo, rather then if it be onely faire Water; and alſo ought to be ſuffocated, and

               <p>Neither was it my Intention, to have here ſaid any thing more, touching this ſo <hi>Peſtilential,</hi> and <hi>Contagious</hi> a Diſeaſe; ſave onely to ſet down what <hi>Antidotal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> and <hi>Preſervatives,</hi> I have found to be moſt proper for the driving

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169743:106"/>concerning the ſame, in my <hi>French Treatiſe;</hi> that even the meaneſt Countryman, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are deſtitute of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians adviſe, might at leaſt know, at what time, and what manner both of Medicines, and Meats they are to take, and what to forbear. Whom alſo I ſhould here deſire to take notice, that there is no truſt in the Earth to be given to a ſick Parties <hi>

As it falls out, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other diſeaſes, in that of the <hi>Dropſy;</hi> wherein ſeeing the Patient ordinarily makes Urine but in a very ſmall quantity, and that too after it had been long retained by him; you ſhall have it ſometimes look higher-coloured, then in a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169743:106"/>burning <hi>Feaver:</hi> as it is likewiſe leſs <hi>Red,</hi> in the height of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> then at the Beginning of it: which might deceive both the Phyciſian, and the Patient, unleſs he ſaw him, ſo that he might obſerve his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Speech,</hi> and <hi>Pulſe,</hi> which is the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the Heart; and ſo had opportunity by theſe to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his diſeaſe; and by the ſame to be informed alſo, that as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> growes <hi>Paler,</hi> the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Feaver</hi> increaſeth; and that That, which had inflamed it, was now aſcended upward toward the Head, and there threatned a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and a greater danger of the diſeaſe. So that it is a very plain caſe, that the Patients Urine is by no means to be ſent to the Phyſician, without perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and a due Care taken, that he may have withall a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account given him, by the party that brings it, of whatſoever concernes the preſent ſtate of the Diſeaſe. Although I confeſs, for the moſt part, the Meſſengers, by which the ſick Parties Urine is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169743:107"/>carried to the Phyſician, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are not very able to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſuch a buſineſs, as is the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Patients Account of himſelf to the Phyſician, or of bringing back the Phyſicians Adviſe to the Patient; which yet in many caſes is a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble buſineſs, and neceſſary to be done. And therefore I have ever refuſed to look upon the <hi>

            <p>I have alſo in my <hi>French Treatiſe</hi> endeavored to lay open to the world the abominable Abuſe and Cheat, that is practiſed by ſome <hi>Country Empiricks,</hi> and <hi>Quackſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knaves,</hi> who gaping after their own unjuſt Gaines onely, to the moſt evident ruin of their Patients, are not aſhamed to boaſt, (and the ſimpler ſort of people believe them too) that by looking into the

So that there is no queſtion to be made, but that, in caſe it ſhould ſo fall out, that the party, upon whoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> any ſuch judgment hath been made by ſome of theſe fellowes, ſhould chance to die in earneſt, this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theirs ſo made, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of a bare Inſpection into the <hi>

            <p>Now in the next place I ſhall, according to my Uſuall Method, briefly ſet down, (in favor of thoſe that have not been at al accuſtomed to the <hi>Malignant Exhalations</hi> of this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhealthfull,</hi> and <hi>Dangerous Aire,</hi> and yet are neceſſitated, either to paſs through theſe places, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to make their aboad there for ſome time) ſuch <hi>Medicines,</hi> and Rules of <hi>Diet,</hi> as I conceave moſt proper for their Preſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame. And firſt of all, I would have people take notice, that this <hi>Epidemial Contagious Aire</hi> may poſſibly be ſpread abroad, and ſo not to be truſted, even before the <hi>Beginning</hi> of <hi>Autumn;</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Hot Summers:</hi> and that too, by the ſpace of ſome Weeks ſooner then is uſuall, in caſe the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> hath been very vehement in the <hi>Dog-days,</hi> or perhaps ſome good while before the ſame. For,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169743:108"/>we conceave it a thing not to be doubted of, but that this <hi>Malignant Quality</hi> of the <hi>Aire</hi> is in theſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heats</hi> of the <hi>Seaſons</hi> much more Feirce, and Raging; and ſo much more Dangerous, and Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then it is in other more Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate years, when the <hi>Heat</hi> hath neither been ſo <hi>Vehement,</hi> nor yet of ſo <hi>Long Continuance.</hi> So that it will in this caſe concern thoſe that are careful of their health, to make timely proviſions for themſelves, by getting out of theſe parts before <hi>Summer</hi> is ended: or elſe if their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and Urgent buſineſſe there cannot admit of this flight of theirs; their Bodies muſt then (as a Caſtle is by its <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Trenches</hi>) be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by other Convenient <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives.</hi> And therefore firſt of all I would have them correct the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Aire by ſtrowing <hi>Sweet Herbs</hi> about the roomes of their houſes, and by ſprinkling of <hi>Vineger</hi> about the houſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Aromatical Fumigations.</hi> They muſt alſo take care of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169743:109"/>by drinking every morning a good draught of <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Ale;</hi> and in caſe they are to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they muſt eat a <hi>Breakefaſt</hi> firſt, &amp; drink after it a luſty draught of the like good <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Ale;</hi> or at leaſt they muſt ſup up three, or four ſpoonfulls of <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or rather may drink a draught of <hi>Wormewood-Wine</hi> (if it may be had) before they go abroad into the open Aire. But neither muſt they neglect the care of their <hi>Smell;</hi> but muſt fortifie their <hi>Noſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Contagiouſneſſe of this <hi>Peſtilential Aire,</hi> by ſmelling to <hi>ſtrong-ſented</hi> things; as they muſt likewiſe their <hi>Mouth,</hi> by chewing ſuch things, as I have preſcribed in my former Diſcourſe of the <hi>Plague.</hi> And theſe things, which I have here preſcribed, are chiefly to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſuch are unacquainted with this <hi>Malignant Aire,</hi> and yet are neceſſitated to go to theſe places, and perhaps to make ſome ſtay there. Yet ſeeing it is ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtful, whether the <hi>Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169743:109"/>Quality</hi> of this <hi>Contagious Aire</hi> may be ſufficiently corrected by the aforeſaid Remedies, they ſhall (if they be wiſe) do well to haſten their departure thence; that by this more certain remedy they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all diſpoſition toward thoſe ſo Long, and Dangerous Diſeaſes: leaſt being, before they are aware thereof, ſeized upon by the ſame, they increaſe the number of that vaſt multitude of perſons that have periſhed thereby. For thus ſome very Honorable, and Eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and thus alſo ſome <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> of the <hi>Provincial Councel of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> having in the <hi>Vacation Time</hi> been held there by their buſineſs for ſome long time, and being not at all Armed againſt the Malignity of that Contagious Aire, when as the diſeaſe raged in thoſe parts in an extraordinary manner; they have been infected with it; and ſo returning to their homes, have there either layen miſerably langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing for a long time; or elſe have in a little while died of the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:169743:110"/>
            <p>To theſe I can adde diverſe, both <hi>Colonels, Captains, Counts,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes;</hi> who having had occaſion of being in the ſaid Parts, or in any other, that have been recovered from the Sea, by caſting up of Banks againſt it, or elſe in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fenny Places,</hi> where they have been neceſſitated either to meet with their Enemy, or perhaps to keep Garriſons there; having been aſſaulted by theſe <hi>Contagious Aires,</hi> have either upon the place, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being removed ſome whither elſe, yeilded up both the Victory, and their lives too, to the ſame.</p>
            <p>All which things ſeeing I am very certainly aſſured of, as having bin a a moſt diligent obſerver of the ſame, ever ſince I practiſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two and fifty years, I could not but give a light touch of the ſame; leaſt if they ſhould be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Oblivion, and no Notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, the world might yet be to ſeek for the ſame, both to our own great detriment, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

            <p>As concerning the Curing of the aforeſaid <hi>Feavers,</hi> as they are <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mial,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of the ſame, ſeeing I my ſelf have written abundantly in my <hi>French Treatiſe,</hi> and other approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors alſo have treated largely of the ſaid <hi>Feavers,</hi> though proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other cauſes, (of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways of curing whereof there is notwithſtanding little regard, or notice to be taken,) I ſhall not here ſay any thing; but ſhall onely in this my <hi>Second Diſcourſe</hi> add to the former, ſuch other things, as I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169743:111"/>found to be very rarely made uſe of, and yet were ſuch as I conceived were of moſt excellent uſe in this caſe. And yet I know very well, that thoſe that are of the more Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſort in our Profeſſion, have preſently a ſtrong prejudice againſt whatſoever they finde to be diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common way of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,</hi> and which are commended to be the better, and more uſefull things: and I know beſides, that there are ſome of them, whoſe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itch agen to be ſcribling; that ſo they may ſhew to the world, that they have lighted upon ſome thing which they can contradict. Which occaſion of quarrelling, I confeſſe, they may very eaſily pick out of what I have delivered in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> touching the <hi>Gout;</hi> concerning which there are found ſo many different Opinions, and Arguments, as that thoſe that are unacquainted with, and have not experience of my <hi>New Way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> herein, may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently furniſhed with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169743:111"/>the ſame, ſo as to be able to hold Argument againſt my Reaſons, though they have been confirmed by daily Experience; although they will never be able to overthrow them. As for inſtance, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things it may be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that I maintain that the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or <hi>Hip-Gout</hi> is always cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> or <hi>Salt Humor;</hi> and that the ſame, although it were never ſo Violent, and raged never ſo much, and was ſuch, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would have been very long in curing, hath yet been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, and perfectly cured, by drinking a cup of Cold <hi>Well,</hi> or <hi>Fountain</hi>-Water, in the manner, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imes before preſcribed; provided this courſe be taken in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as this our <hi>Cold Water</hi> is uſed to cure moſt ſtrangely, and certainly, both in this caſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, being taken as well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as applied Outwardly; yet will not theſe men willingly admit of the ſame: much leſs will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169743:112"/>they believe, that the applying of the ſame upon the part Affected, being afflicted either with a <hi>Hot,</hi> or <hi>Cold</hi> Humor, can produce the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red effect. And eſpecially they will be ready to maintain, that it is both an Abſurd, and an Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, that the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> being repelled, and driven back toward the Bowells, by the <hi>Immerſion</hi> of the <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> in <hi>Cold Water,</hi> and being there heated, ſhould return, and diſpell the <hi>Cold Diſtemperature,</hi> and Nummedneſſe of the ſame: and again, that on the contrary, both the <hi>Spirits</hi> and the <hi>Blood,</hi> being in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by the ſame <hi>Cold Water</hi> driven back, and hindered from their return to the Part Affected, ſhall cure the ſaid <hi>Feet,</hi> when they have been any way hurt, and are thereby inflamed. And yet that both theſe effects are wrought by this our <hi>Cold Water,</hi> if they pleaſe but to make trial of the ſame, <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> it ſelf (which is always the Inſeparable Companion of <hi>Reaſon</hi>)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169743:112"/>will make manifeſt unto them. Which very thing <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> alſo conſidering, yet withall ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brevity, where he writes of this ſubject; he did not ſet down his Reaſons, but left the buſineſs to the Examination of others; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is written: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, &amp; invenietis,</hi> ſeek, and ye ſhall finde. Although notwithſtanding I muſt confeſs that I beleeve, that it hath pleaſed Almighty God, though not in this caſe, yet in ſome other, (as is Evident in the <hi>Plague,</hi> and other <hi>Peſtilential Diſeaſes</hi>) not to reveale to Man the <hi>Occult Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> of ſome things. For, it was neceſſary, that nothing ſhould be Prefect, but Himſelf onely.</p>
            <p>And I beleeve, it will ſeem Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, to many, rather then Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that by the ſaid Application of <hi>Cold Water,</hi> or by the Immerſion of the part Affected into the ſame, ſuch <hi>Wounds</hi> as I have before ſpoke of, with great <hi>Swellings</hi> and <hi>Bruiſes,</hi> may be perfectly, and more ſafely cured, then by any other <hi>Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:169743:113"/>way of Operation; and that, by the <hi>Firſt Intention,</hi> without brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame to <hi>Suppuration,</hi> and without any <hi>Pain, Impoſtumation</hi> or <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> cauſed in the <hi>part affected;</hi> concerning which, I underſtand, I have been cenſured by ſome, that yet never made trial of this <hi>New way of Practiſe,</hi> but extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry this Truth, (with though themſelves are ignorant of, is yet very certainly known to others:) and, laughing extreamly at it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand how it is poſſible, that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Remedy, and ſo ready at hand as this is, againſt ſo Common, and ſo Dangerous Diſaſters, could ly ſo long hid, and concealed from the world, to the ſo great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prejudice of Mankinde. Whom notwithſtanding (that they may not any longer envy the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Good,</hi> and ſeem to look after their own <hi>Private Gain</hi> onely; and may forbear by ſtriving againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> to draw any more ſcandall upon themſelves,) I do here aſſure, that I have found by Experience, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169743:113"/>very many caſes, where there have been <hi>Great Swellings</hi> accompanying the <hi>Wounds,</hi> that by the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid <hi>Cold Water</hi> to the Part, or the <hi>Immerſion</hi> of it in the ſame, for a good while together, as hath before been ſhewed, though this were done the next day after the hurt receaved, yet the <hi>Swelling</hi> hath fallen, and the <hi>Sore,</hi> being cleared from all <hi>Purulent Matter,</hi> hath cloſed up within three days, and the Part Affected hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered its former ſtrength againe. Yet notwithſtanding I adviſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (though, I confeſs, I have found it to ſucceed well enough, where I have had to do) that they would not be too raſhly confident in this ſo <hi>Late Application</hi> of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Neither can they want Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which they may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves out of the Beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to prove, that <hi>Letting of Blood, Purging Medicines,</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> and of good uſe in the Cure of the <hi>Plague:</hi> all which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169743:114"/>in thoſe <hi>Plagues</hi> that have reigned in our times, both here, and in other places, and in that which began to rage againe at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> in the beginning of the yeer 1647. and ended the yeer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I never approved of, but always held them for ſuſpected, and dangerous. And where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Pleuriſie, Peripneumony,</hi> or <hi>Quinſey,</hi> accompanying the <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Diſeaſe,</hi> ſeems to require the <hi>Opening of a Vein;</hi> the Skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician may order matters as he ſhal think fit, with all due care: and yet after all his care, in ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a <hi>Complication</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> the may have very good cauſe to doubt that none but an unhappy ſucceſs is like to follow; unleſs, that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> may here have any place, where he ſaies, that <hi>Probably, nothing is Impoſſible to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I confeſs I ſhall willingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to thoſe Authors, who though they will not allow of theſe <hi>Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> while the <hi>Venom</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> is ſtrong upon the Patient,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169743:114"/>do yet, when the ſaid <hi>Venom</hi> is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well overcome, and when the ſick parties ſtrength is not too much weakned, admit of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> in very <hi>Plethorical</hi> Bodies: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low likewiſe of <hi>Purges,</hi> where the Body digeſts ill, and abounds with <hi>Putrid Humors:</hi> yet for as much as the Diſeaſe is not to be reckoned, now, to be within the Compaſſe of the <hi>Plague;</hi> and alſo becauſe thoſe, that uſually attend upon Infected Perſons, are not of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Capacity for the Managing of theſe Matters, I have therefore paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them by in ſilence.</p>
            <p>I know beſides very well, that I have rendred my ſelf Obnoxious to the complaints of Impatient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, eſpecially in the <hi>Gout;</hi> who while they deſire to have that remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which cannot poſſibly be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wil break out (together with the Carping <hi>Zoili</hi> of our age, of whom there is no end) into I know not what ſcoffing, and abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Yet I muſt deſire theſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169743:115"/>Gentlemen to remember, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways excepted al <hi>Knotty,</hi> and <hi>Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gouts;</hi> which, as ſometimes we cannot aſſwage the pains in them according as we could wiſh, ſo much leſs can we cure them total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the drinking of <hi>Cold Water:</hi> as neither by the <hi>Opening of a Vein,</hi> the <hi>Pain,</hi> although it be not an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate</hi> one, is aſſwaged; ſo long as the <hi>Next Antecedent Cauſe</hi> is too ſtrongly ſetled in the Neighboring <hi>Veins,</hi> and is alſo diffuſed far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout through the other Veins. However it is ſufficient, that it is moſt evidently ſometimes of good uſe, as alſo that <hi>Cold Water,</hi> both in this Diſeaſe of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and in other Caſes alſo, hath done very much good; where whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicines were taken, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, or none at all: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in hath ſeldom failed of aſſwaging the pain of the ſame, and hath ſometimes quite taken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; nay, and hath utterly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and baniſhed it from the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169743:115"/>Patient, and that in a ſhort ſpace of time too; eſpecially, where the <hi>Opening of a Vein</hi> hath been joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it.</p>
            <p>Neither did I ever ſay, that we were to expect a happy ſucceſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from it: in like manner as we know, that ſuch as are ſick of a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> may begin too late to to make uſe of <hi>VVhey,</hi> and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Rhubarb:</hi> eſpecially when the <hi>Small Guts</hi> are very much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded, or when the <hi>Great Guts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much fretted by the <hi>Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Humors,</hi> begin to putrifie, and are inclined toward being gangrened.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe, when in the <hi>Plague,</hi> at the very beginning of the Diſeaſe, the Patient takes not a <hi>Sudorifical Preſervative;</hi> and when need ſo requires, doth not repeat the ſame: or perhaps, when, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome Impediment interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it cannot be adminiſtred, or if it be adminiſtred, yet it may be overmaſtred by the <hi>Venom</hi> of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169743:116"/>Diſeaſe, which may be ſo ſtrong, and powerful, as that by its exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Malignity, it can take away a man in a quarter of an houres ſpace. So that I would have all men take notice, that I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to maintain that this Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Dangerous Enemy,</hi> was not ſo fearful a thing, as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to be; but I rather maintain the contrary, and ſay that it is really ſuch. All that <hi>I</hi> intended to inſinuate, was onely this; that if it were taken at the very beginning of it, it was much eaſier to be overmaſtered, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then moſt people imagine, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there be nothing to hinder the putting in practiſe of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: as <hi>I</hi> have found by moſt diligent obſervation, and by the faithful relation of many, that (by Gods bleſſing) have been moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily preſerved by takeing ſuch <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives,</hi> and other things, as <hi>I</hi> have preſcribed; eſpecially, at the beginning of the Diſeaſe; wherein,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169743:116"/>though abſent, <hi>I</hi> took all the care that could be, that they might be rightly and duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
            <p>As my purpoſe was likewiſe to publiſh to the world, by what <hi>Preſervatives,</hi> and <hi>Cordials,</hi> and by obſerving of what <hi>Regiment of Health,</hi> very many, who in ſeveral places where the Peſtilence raged extreamly, attended upon, and were continually in the houſe with thoſe that were infected, though they themſelves had never before been ſick of the ſame, nor had been ever before accuſtomed to this ſo ſubtly-infecting an Aire, yet (by Gods mercy) were miraculouſly, and to the admiration of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, preſerved, and kept from any the leſt infection. And among theſe, and other the like things, I could not but give notice here, of how great uſe, and indeed how Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this caſe <hi>Wine Vineger</hi> is; as the drinking of <hi>Whey</hi> is, in the <hi>Griping Flux</hi> of the Belly; and the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169743:117"/>
               <hi>Drinking,</hi> and <hi>Outward Application</hi> of <hi>Cold VVater</hi> alſo is, in the <hi>Gout,</hi> and many other <hi>Pains</hi> in the Body,</p>
            <p>The great force of which <hi>Three Liquors,</hi> and the Marvelous Vertues that God hath endowed them with, for the Good, and Preſervation of Mankind, when <hi>I</hi> had by moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and Diligent inquiry into, and a long making uſe of the ſame with good ſucceſſe, been moſt certainly aſſured of; <hi>I</hi> at length reſolved to write of the ſame, and publiſh them to the world in Print, in ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſmall Treatiſe, concerning the Diſeaſe called <hi>Cholera;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Epidemial Diſeaſes,</hi> and their <hi>Symptomes,</hi> and touching the <hi>Biting of a Mad Dog.</hi> Which <hi>I</hi> the more willingly did, becauſe <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, that the uſe of theſe <hi>Three Liquors</hi> may not onely be intruſted to ſuch, as are not at all skilled in Our Profeſſion, but rather ought indeed to be commended unto them; if there be any regard to be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169743:117"/>had to <hi>Humane Infirmity,</hi> or <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> if not to <hi>Mutual Charity:</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it ſo falls out for the moſt part, that either a Phyſician can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had ſo timely, as is requiſite in theſe Diſeaſes; or perhaps, if the Diſeaſe raigne hot in the place, will not come when he is called: and alſo becauſe that in the curing of thoſe Diſeaſes for which the uſe of theſe <hi>Liquors</hi> are deſigned, and in the adminiſtring of the ſame, all people may have (though not an exact, yet) a Confuſed knowledge at leſt, and ſuch as is in ſome ſort ſufficient for the buſineſs in hand; ſo that their adminiſtring of the ſame (to ſpeake cleerly) cannot but do very much good: and eſpecially when the Urgency of the Neceſſity requires the ſame, and cannot admit of any Delay; wherein there would be, for the moſt part, moſt Evident, and moſt Preſent Danger; as <hi>Ovid</hi> to this purpoſe well alludes, where he ſaies:

            <p>Which Verſes, if any where, they have place chiefly here, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and in ſuch other Contagious Diſeaſes, where the Venom of the ſame is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fierce, as that it in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diffuſeth it ſelf through the body; and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Flux</hi> of the <hi>Belly;</hi> in which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there is no wearing out, and Digeſture of the <hi>Venom</hi> by length of time, to be expected. In like manner as I my ſelf, being taken with this diſeaſe in the Seventy Sixth yeer of my Age (at which time alſo <hi>I</hi> was buſie in putting this preſent <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to the Preſs,) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving, toward the Evening, ſome <hi>Bloody Corroſion</hi> of the <hi>Guts</hi> fallen upon me; <hi>I</hi> did not at all defence
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169743:119"/>the buſineſs, but reſolved preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall to taking of Phyſick, (though it were then late at night) to purge out the <hi>Acrimonious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor:</hi> and I drank as much <hi>Whey</hi> as poſſibly I could; and that with ſo good ſucceſſe, as that I quite freed my ſelf from it in the ſpace of four and twenty hours. And the ſame ſucceſſe have I had, in the ſame diſeaſe, two other ſeverall times, by uſing the ſelf ſame courſe.</p>
            <p>And I would have people alſo take notice, that it was not in vaine, that in my <hi>French Treatiſe</hi> I gave my Judgement, that in the <hi>Jaundiſe,</hi> at the very beginning of the Diſeaſe, the Patient was to have <hi>Purging Medicines</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto him; which are to be repeated alſo for four, or five daies together, if need ſo require; that the <hi>Conjunct Cauſe</hi> it ſelf alſo, which being let alone, growes hard, and in time too ſometimes petrifies, may be driven out of its <hi>Bladder,</hi> into the Guts. And to the end
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169743:119"/>that men may the eaſier believe how Neceſſary this Feſtination is in theſe diſeaſes, <hi>I</hi> ſhall here, for the greater benefit of the Publike, adde, that <hi>I</hi> my ſelf, about ſome fifteen daies before the aforeſaid <hi>Dyſentery</hi> ſeized upon me, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taken with the <hi>Jaundiſe;</hi> before the appearing whereof, <hi>I</hi> had a <hi>Griping Paine</hi> in my <hi>Belly;</hi> whereupon immediately followed the <hi>Whiteneſſe</hi> of its <hi>Excrements,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a very <hi>Thick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> which alſo had a <hi>Yellow Froth</hi> float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Top of it: all which, together with the diffuſion of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> all over the body, as appeared by the <hi>Yellowneſſe</hi> of my <hi>Skin,</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed that it was the <hi>Jaundiſe.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, (by Gods bleſſing,) though <hi>I</hi> was of ſo great an Age, <hi>I</hi> perfectly recovered from this ſo Dangerous a Diſeaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five days after it ſeized upon me; after <hi>I</hi> had purged for three daies together, and that in a much greater abundance, then many
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169743:120"/>men, if they were of my age, would be able to bear.</p>
            <p>And in like manner as in <hi>Wounds,</hi> which are beſt and moſt ſafely cured by the <hi>Firſt Intention,</hi> the <hi>Ripening</hi> of the <hi>Purulent Matter</hi> is by all means to be prevented; ſo neither in the Diſeaſe, called <hi>Cholera,</hi> are people to protract the time, and expect the <hi>Digeſture,</hi> and wearing out of the <hi>Malignant Humour;</hi> which, being taken in time, according as <hi>I</hi> have before preſcribed, may eaſily be overma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, by giving the party <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> his <hi>Pill,</hi> to the quantity of four, or five Graines; and ſo the patient would by this courſe as ſpeedily be cured, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, without it, he would be loſt. And hence it is, that many liken this Diſeaſe to a <hi>Battell</hi> in <hi>War,</hi> in which, (as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith,)
<q>Aut cita mors venit, aut Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria laeta.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:169743:120"/>
            <p>That is:
<q>
                  <l>We ſoon are loſt;</l>
                  <l>Or Conqueſt boaſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And for this reaſon the <hi>Dutch</hi> call this Diſeaſe, in their Language, <hi>Kuyters Zieckte,</hi> that is, <hi>The Horſeman Diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For very good reaſon therefore have we commended the Uſe of the aforeſaid <hi>Three Liquors;</hi> ſeeing that, beſides that by reaſon of their Excellent Virtue in the aforeſaid Diſeaſes, they are far to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any other the moſt pretious Medicines that are; they are alſo agreable to the Palate, and are every where to be had, as well by Poor, as Rich. For <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is accounted a thing of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at all; and as for <hi>Vineger,</hi> and <hi>Whey,</hi> they bear no high price nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and beſides, becauſe that thoſe <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> in which the uſe of theſe <hi>Liquors</hi> is chiefly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are very frequent every where;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169743:121"/>and are ſo common, as that they make our Phyſicians the greateſt part of their buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Neither would I have any to think, that, the vertues of theſe <hi>Three Liquors,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Whey</hi> are to be confined within the bounds of the aforeſaid Diſeaſes onely: For, what skilfull Phyſitian is there that will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that in the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> a <hi>Feaveriſh Diſtemper,</hi> this <hi>Whey</hi> mixed with the <hi>Juyce of Citron</hi> may be adminiſtred for a <hi>Julip,</hi> and for an <hi>Apozeme,</hi> the ſame <hi>Whey,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> decocted with <hi>Sorrel,</hi> or <hi>Succory,</hi> or the like Herbs, and with ſome of the <hi>Opening Roots,</hi> or other things, of like quality, may be adminiſtred? if ſo be the Phyſician perceaves that there is any <hi>Obſtruction,</hi> and that the ſame requires this courſe: into ſo much whereof as is ſtrained out for uſe, a little Sugar may be put in to make it the more pleaſant to the taſt; all which Medicines may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169743:121"/>and for little charge be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by poor folks; and may with as great Advantage, and Eaſe be made by others too. For there is no need of any great number of Ingredients; which, by reaſon of the Diverſity of their Qualities, prove oftentimes a hindrance to each other. For theſe things are enough, that are proper, and are of Vertue ſufficient for the effecting of the buſineſs, when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and adminiſtred in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Quantity. Nay, <hi>Whey</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alone, or <hi>Water</hi> taken alone, do many times abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Expectation of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: as <hi>Gulen</hi> alſo tells us, that a luſty draught of <hi>Cold Water</hi> is a moſt preſent Remedy in a <hi>Burning Feaver.</hi> And, I confeſs, <hi>I</hi> my ſelfe had rather adminiſter <hi>Whey</hi> alone in the <hi>Griping Flux</hi> of the <hi>Belly,</hi> then to give it mixt with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that are proper for the aſſwaging of the Acrimony of the Humors: neither do <hi>I</hi> approve of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169743:122"/>putting into it ſo much as the leſt quantity of <hi>Sugar,</hi> to render it the more pleaſant to the Taſt; neither yet do <hi>I</hi> allow of the putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ordinary Clyſters;</hi> leaſt they ſhould cauſe the ſame to work too much, and ſhould exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the Exulceration.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>I</hi> ſhall now conclude, with this commendation of theſe <hi>Three Liquors;</hi> and willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit both this Compendious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as alſo that which I wrote in <hi>French,</hi> both of them in my own Plain, and Ordinary Style, to the Prudent Judgement of the more Learned of our Profeſſion, and to the Courteous Reader; and for a Cloſe of all ſhall profeſs, that I have faithfully, and Sincerely written thoſe things which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved were the Trueſt; without any purpoſe in the world of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from any one, from whom I diſſent in Opinion; nor have at all ſought hereby after Fame. But my Only Deſign, and the drift of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169743:122"/>my Writing hath been, to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate both my ſelf, and all my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to the Publike Good; and I earneſtly intreat the Reader, that he would accept of this Work of Mine, ſuch as it is, with the ſame mind that it was written; and would vouchſafe to take in good part, and favourably interpret all things, as they have been written by me; and that of what things have been by Me brought into Common Practiſe, (though hitherto not made uſe of in theſe Caſes) in thoſe common Diſeaſes that ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently befal Mankinde, he would boldly adventure to make due and ſeaſonable Triall.</p>
